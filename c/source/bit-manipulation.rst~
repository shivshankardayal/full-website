Bit Manipulation
****************
By now you have seen all constructs of C programming language. In this chapter
we will study bit-manipulation using operators provided by C. Bit manipulation
is considered low-level programming can result in hard to read code but can
improve performance significantly if done right. Most of the bit manipulation
involve numbers and in few cases you can apply it to characters because
characters are internally integers. The key to bit-manipulation is bitwise
operators `&, ^, |, !, ~ <<` and `>>` operators which stand for AND, XOR, OR,
NOT, bit-flipping, left-shift and right-shift operators. Given below is truth
table for AND, XOR, and OR gate for quick reference.

In C, 0 represents `false` and any non-negative value represents `true`. Note
that both are keywords.
