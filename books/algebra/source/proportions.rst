Proportions
***********
There are many times when two ratios are equal. Then the four quantities
involved in these two ratios are said to be in proportion or **proportionals**.
Thus if :math:`a:b=c:d` then :math:`a, b, c` and :math:`d` are proportionals
or are in proportion. It is also written as

.. math::
  a:b::c:d.

The terms :math:`a` and `d` are called the *extremes* and :math:`b` and
:math:`c` are the *means*. Clearly, as you can see that if there is such
a proportion then product of extremes is equal to the product of means i.e.
:math:`ad=bc`.

Continues Proportion
====================
Quatities are said to be in **continued proportion** when first is to second
is equal to second is to third, third is to fourth is equal to first two; and
so on. Therefore, if

.. math::
  \frac{a}{b}=\frac{b}{c}=\frac{c}{d}=.....

then :math:`a, b, c, d, ...` are in contunued proportion.
