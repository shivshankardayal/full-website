Multi-threaded Programming
**************************
Even though it has been some time since C11 specification has been published
and multi-threaded programming is now supported by language specification gcc
does not support it yet because of dependency problems with glib. I do not
think it will come soon but eventually it will be implemented. Till then we
have to wait.

For now you can read "Programming with POSIX Threads" by David R. Butenhof.
