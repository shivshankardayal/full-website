Preface
*******
Welcome to this book on C programming using a particular specification version
C11. As of now C1 is the latest specification fully implemented by C
compilers. However, not all elements of the specification is implemented by
compilers, for example, `gcc` does not implement multithreading.

These days I have noticed a tendency that people
think Java, PHP or Python are more used and they have a tendency to overlook
the merits of C as a programming language. The benefits of learning C is
described further in Chapter 1 "Introduction".
