Quadratic Equations Solutions Part 3
************************************
101. Since :math:`\alpha, \beta` are roots of the equation :math:`x^2 - px + q = 0`, :math:`\alpha + \beta = p` and
     :math:`\alpha\beta = q`

     Let us assume that :math:`\alpha + \frac{1}{\beta}` is a root of :math:`qx^2 - p(1 + q)x + (1 + q)^2 = 0` then
     it must satisfy the equation. Substituting the values we have

     :math:`\alpha\beta\frac{(\alpha\beta + 1)^2}{\beta^2} - \frac{(\alpha + \beta)(1 + \alpha\beta)(\alpha\beta +
     1)}{\beta} + (1 + \alpha\beta)^2 = 0`

     :math:`(\alpha\beta + 1)^2[\alpha\beta - (\alpha + \beta)\beta - \beta^2] = 0`

     :math:`\because L. H. S. = R. H. S.` it is proven that :math:`\alpha + \frac{1}{\beta}` is a root of the given
     equation.
102. Let :math:`\alpha` be a common root. Then,

     :math:`\frac{\alpha^2}{-8m - 6} = \frac{\alpha}{4 + 6} = \frac{1}{9 - 8m}`

     Solving for :math:`m` we obtain :math:`\frac{7}{4}` and :math:`-\frac{11}{8}` as two values.
103. Proceeding as previous part we find :math:`a = 24`
104. The condition for having common roots is

     :math:`(ba - c^2)(ca - b^2) = (a^2 - bc)^2`

     :math:`a^2bc - ab^3 - ac^3 + b^2c^2 = a^4 - 2a^2bc + b^2c^2`

     :math:`3a^2bc - ab^3 -ac^3 - a^4 = 0`

     :math:`a(3abc - b^3 - c^3 - a^3) = 0`

     :math:`\because a\ne = 0 \Rightarrow a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = 0`

     :math:`(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) = 0`

     :math:`\Rightarrow a + b + c = 0` or :math:`a = b = c`
105. Proceeding as in last example, condition for common root is

     :math:`(10m - 189)(9 - 10) = (21 - m)^2`

     :math:`189 - 10m = 441 - 42m + m^2 \Rightarrow m^2 - 32m + 252 = 0 \Rightarrow m = 18, 14`

     Roots of :math:`x^2 + 10x + 21 = 0` are :math:`-3, -7`

     When :math:`m = 18` roots of :math:`x^2 + 9x + 18 = 0` are :math:`-3, -6`

     In that case equation formed with :math:`-7` and :math:`-6` is :math:`x^2 + 13x + 42 = 0`

     When :math:`m= 14` roots of :math:`x^2 + 9x + 14 = 0` are :math:`-2, -7`

     In that case equation formed with :math:`-3` and :math:`-2` are :math:`x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0`
106. Following condition for common roots, we have

     :math:`(-3 + 120)(10 + 3) = (3 + 36)^2`

     :math:`117 * 13 = 39^2` which is true and thus equations have a common root.

     Roots of :math:`x^2 - x - 12 = 0` are :math:`4, -3` and roots of :math:`3x^2 + 10x + 3 = 0` are :math:`-3,
     -\frac{1}{3}` and thus common root is :math:`-3`
107. Again condition for common root is given below:

     :math:`(p - q)(3q - 2p) = (3 - 2)^2`

     :math:`(2p - 3q)(p - q) + 1 = 0`

     :math:`2p^2 + 3q^2 - 5pq + 1 = 0`
108. Again repeating the condition for common root we have

     :math:`(b - c)(a - b) =  (a - c)^2`

     :math:`ab - ac - b^2 + bc = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac`

     :math:`a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 0`

     :math:`\frac{1}{2}(a - b)^2(b - c)^2(c - a)^2 = 0`

     :math:`\Rightarrow a = b = c`
109. Let :math:`\alpha` be the common root then

     :math:`\frac{\alpha^2}{pq_1 - p_1q} = \frac{\alpha}{q - q_1} = \frac{1}{p_1 - p}`

     Clearly, the root is either :math:`\frac{pq_1 - p_1q}{q - q_1}` or :math:`\frac{q - q_1}{p_1 - p}`

110. Condition for having common root is:

     :math:`(-4b + 3c)(-6a - 2b) = (4a - 2c)^2`

     Solving this we arrive at the given condition.
111. Condition for having a common root is:

     :math:`[(r - p)(q - r) - (p - q)^2][(p - q)(q - r) - (r - p)^2] = [(q - r)^2 - (p - q)(r - p)]^2`

     Solving this leads to an equality which means the equations have a common root.
112. Let :math:`\alpha` be a common root then

     :math:`\frac{\alpha^2}{ab^2 - ac^2} = \frac{1}{b - c} = \frac{1}{ac - ab}`

     :math:`\alpha = -a(b + c)` or :math:`\alpha = -\frac{1}{a}`

     Let :math:`\alpha, \beta` be roots of first and :math:`\alpha, \gamma` be roots of the second equation. Then,
     :math:`\alpha + \beta = -ab` and :math:`\alpha\beta = c` also, :math:`\alpha + \gamma = -ac` and
     :math:`\alpha\gamma = b`

     :math:`\Rightarrow 2\alpha + \beta + \gamma = -a(b + c)` and :math:`\alpha^2\beta\gamma = bc`

     Equation formed by :math:`\beta` and :math:`\gamma` would be

     :math:`x^2 - (\beta + \gamma)x + \beta\gamma = 0`

     For either values of :math:`\alpha` equation is

     :math:`x^2 - a(b + c)x + a^2bc = 0`
113. This question has been left as an exercise.
114. It is a quadratic equation but satisfied by three values of :math:`x = 1, 2, 3` therefore it is an identity.
115. It is a quadratic equation but satisfied by three values of :math:`x = a, b, c` therefore it is an identity.
116. Let :math:`x^5 = y` then equation becomes :math:`3y^2 - 2y - 8 = 0`

     Since it is satisfied by two distinct values and it is a quadratic equation therefore it is an equation.
117. :math:`\frac{(x + 2)^2 - (x - 2)^2}{x^2 - 4} = \frac{5}{6}`

     :math:`\frac{8x}{x^2 - 4} = \frac{5}{6}`

     :math:`5x^2 - 20 - 48x = 0`

     :math:`x = 10 , -\frac{2}{5}`
118. Let :math:`x = y^2`

     :math:`\Rightarrow \frac{2y + 1}{3 - y} = \frac{11 - 3y}{5y - 9}`

     :math:`10y^2 - 13y - 9 = 33 - 20y + 3y^2`

     :math:`7y^2 + 7y - 42 = 0`

     :math:`y = 2, -3`

     :math:`x = 4, 9` but :math:`x = 9` does not apply to the equation and is an impossible solution.
119. :math:`(x + 1)(x - 3)(x + 2)(x - 4) = 336`

     :math:`(x^2 - 2x - 3)(x^2 - 2x - 8) = 336`

     Let :math:`x^2 - 2x - 3 = y`

     :math:`y(y - 5) = 336`

     :math:`y^2 - 5y - 336 = 0`

     :math:`y = 21, -16`

     :math:`\Rightarrow x = -4, 6, 1 \pm 2\sqrt{3}i`

     120 and 121 are left as an exercise.
