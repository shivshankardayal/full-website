Permutations and Combinations Solutions Part 7
**********************************************
301. No. of ways of dividing :math:`n` different things :math:`a` groups each containing
     :math:`b` things :math:`= \frac{n!}{(b!)^aa!}` which is an integer. Thus,
     we can see that :math:`(n - 1)!` is clearly divisible :math:`b`.

     Similarly, we can prove that :math:`(n - 1)!` is divisible by :math:`a`

302. No. of ways of dividing :math:`kn` different things in :math:`k` groups
     each containing :math:`n` things is :math:`\frac{kn!}{k!(n!)^k}` which is
     an integer and thus our requirement is satisfied.

303. Let :math:`r = 5, n= 20,` then required number :math:`= {}^{n + r - 1}C_r`

     :math:`= {}^{24}C_{20}`

304. :math:`{}^{n + r - 1}C_r`

305. Given :math:`x\geq 1, y\geq 1, z\geq 1`

     :math:`x + y + z = n`

     Thus, no. of solution :math:`= {}^{n + 3 - 1}C_n = {}^{n + 2}C_n = {}^{n +
     2}C_2`

306. :math:`x + y + z = 0 \forall x, y, z\geq -5` can be rewritten as
     :math:`a + b + c = 15 \forall a, b, c\geq 0`

     Thus, answer is :math:`{}^{15 + 3 - 1}C_2 = 136`

307. Required number :math:`=` coeff. of :math:`x^{3n}` in :math:`(1 + x +
     \ldots + x^n)^3(1 + x + \ldots + x^{3n})`

Rest of the problems are left as exercises.
