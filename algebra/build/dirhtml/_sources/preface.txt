Preface
*******
While I was writing data structure book and helping few junior programmers I
found that the prerequisite knowledge of Mathematics is required and lacking
respectively. Therefore I decided to write a decided to write a series of
books on Mathematics which will help people interested grasp the basics of
computer science. I understand that Mathematics alone is not sufficient as
you need some Chemistry and Physics also to understand the hardware but that
is for later. Note that I will write this book as if I am talking to
you(my reader).

Computer science is a descipline evolved out of Mathematics which was assited
by Physics, Chamistry and other engineering branches for hardware. :-) For
those who do not know Mathematics is known as "Queen of Sciences". I prefer
to call it "Lord of Subjects". The very reason is that even though you have
never gone to a school and are illiterate you use Mathematics in your
everyday life.

Mathematics is both simple and dificult. Simple if you can understand the
abstractions involved in it and you have imagination to understand concepts
like plane and imaginary number. You need strong visualizaiton in your mind
if you want to study 2D or 3D geometry. TO solve problems you need strong
logical and analytical ability. And many times you need to wonder "how is
this possible?".

To begin with I will start wil Algebra which has relations with word Algorithm
in computer science. To put it simple you know some Algebra before reading
this book before I assume you can do basic arithmetic. Addition and other
trivial (but most important) operations are part of Algebra. To begin with
I will start with number system because the concept of binary, octal, decimal
and hexadecimal numbers are heavily used in computers. Then I will move on
to other topics.

**Advice & Warning:** This is how you should study the book. You must
read theory portion carefully and then try all problems yourself. You will need
pen(or pencil; your preference) and paper ofcourse. If you cannot solve a
problem lookup the solution and try to understand it. Even if you understand
the solution you should take another attempt at solving the problem again
without looking at solution. Make sure that you do not **skip** even
a single problem. Remember *practice* is everything in Mathematics. When the
problem set will be too large then it will be split into several chapters as
MathJax may casue trouble when rendering lots of Mathematical equations.

Who this book is for?
=====================
This book can be read by anyone remotely interested in Algebra. People/students
of needing high school study mateial will benefit most from it. Programmers
looking to brush up there skill will most definitely benefit from it and I
must recommemnd it for them. People involved in Mathematical programming like
Octave will also find it useful. Game programmers and graphics programmers
would love to read the content.

Prerequisite
============
Not much is needed. First ten years of school educaiton should be suficient
for most of the material.

Looking for hard copy?
======================
I am sorry but no hard copy or pdf will be available online. I can give pdf
copies for free to individuals if you contact me through email. This book will
never be published or you can make one yourself using sphinx sources available
at website.

Problems and solutions are given in separate chapters to avoid rendering delay
of MathJax.
