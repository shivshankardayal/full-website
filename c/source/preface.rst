Preface
*******
Welcome to this book on C programming using a particular specification version
C11. As of now C1 is the latest specification fully implemented by C
compilers. However, not all elements of the specification is implemented by
compilers, for example, `gcc` does not implement multithreading.

These days I have noticed a tendency that people
think Java, PHP or Python are more used and they have a tendency to overlook
the merits of C as a programming language. The benefits of learning C is
described further in Chapter 1 "Introduction".

C is one of the language which is closest to system and very useful for system
programming though not limited to it. It is also very fundamental to many
languages as you will discover along your programming endeavours. I highly
recommend that all programmers must learn C programmer in order to become a
better programmer. You do not have many choices in the category of compiled
languages anyway.

This book does not contain a lot of problems and examples. For practice please
checkout my book on data structure and algorithms which will have those. Also,
please read specification because certain sections I have avoided to keep
things simple.

Acknowledgements
================
I do not have much to write in preface as I have covered most of it in
Chapter 1. Therefore, I will skip directly to acknowledgements section. First,
I would like to thank my parents, wife and son for taking out their fair share
of time and the support which they have extended to me during my bad
times. After that I would like to pay my most sincere gratitude to my teachers
particularly H. N. Singh, Yogendra Yadav, Satyanand Satyarthi, Kumar Shailesh
and Prof. T. K. Basu. Now is the turn of people from software community. I must
thank the entire free software community for all the resources they have
developed to make computing better. However, few names I know and here they
go. Richard Stallman is the first, Donald Knuth, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson,
Bjarne Stroustrup after that. I possibly cannot write all the names because
then possibly an entire chapter will be full of those names. :-)

I am not a native English speaker and this book has just gone through one pair
of eyes therefore chances are high that it will have lots of errors. At the
same time it may contain lots of technical errors. Please feel free to drop me
an email at <shivshankar.dayal@gmail.com>. I will try to fix all errors and
incorporate your valuable suggestions.
