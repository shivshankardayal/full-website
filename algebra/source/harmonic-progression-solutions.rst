Harmonic Progression Solutions
******************************
1. The sequence :math:`1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{7}, ...` is an H. P.

   Thus, reciprocals would form an A. P. i.e.

   :math:`1, 3, 5, 7, ...` are in A. P. 100th term of whose is :math:`1 + 99*2 = 199`

   Thus, 100th term of the H. P. in question is :math:`\frac{1}{199}`.
