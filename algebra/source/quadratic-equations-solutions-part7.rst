Quadratic Equations Solutions Part 7
************************************
301. :math:`f(11) = 1331 - 1210 - 121 - 100 < 0`

     :math:`f(12) = 1728 - 1440 - 132 - 100 > 0`

     :math:`f'(x) = 3x^2 - 20x - 11`

     Clearly, :math:`f'(x) > 0~\forall~x > 12`

     Therefore, :math:`f(x)` will have its greatest root between :math:`11` and :math:`12`. Hence, integral
     part of greatest root is :math:`11`.
302. :math:`f(0) = a_n` and :math:`f(1) = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_n` which are both odd numbers.

     :math:`f(2k)=a_n+2(a_{n - 1}k)+2(2a_{n - 2}k^2)+\ldots +2(2^{n-1}k^na_n)` is odd for all :math:`k` and

     :math:`f(2k+1)=\sum_{k=1}^na_k\sum_{i=1}^k{k\choose i}(2k)^i`

     Since all the inner summands are even except when :math:`i = 0` we see that

     :math:`f(2k+1)=2N+\sum_{k=1}^na_k`

     which is even plus add i.e. odd for all values of :math:`k`.

     Thus, for no integer the function is zero hence the function has no integral roots.
303. Let :math:`g(x) = e^xf(x)` then :math:`g"(x) = e^x[f(x) + 2f'(x) + f"(x)]`

     Therefore, roots of :math:`g"(x) = 0` will be same as :math:`f(x) + 2f'(x) + f"(x) = 0` as :math:`e^x \ne 0`

     But since :math:`e^x \ne 0, g(x)` will have same roots as :math:`f(x).`

     Since :math:`f(x) = 0` has three roots :math:`\alpha < \beta < \gamma,` therefore equation :math:`g(x) = 0` will have same
     roots and :math:`g'(x) = 0` will have a root between :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` and other roots between :math:`\beta`
     and :math:`\gamma` and hence :math:`g"(x)` will have a root between :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\gamma.`
304. If this degree four polynomial has four real roots, then there is a local minimum between the first two and between
     the last two roots, and a local maximum between the second and hird root. The location of the extrema does not
     change with :math:`a`, only their :math:`y` values. Thus we are looking for :math:`a` such that the two local
     minima have negative :math:`y` values and the local maximum has positive :math:`y` value.

     Locate the local extrema as roots of the derivative :math:`4x^3 - 12x^2 - 16x` which has roots as :math:`-1, 0, 4`

     :math:`\Rightarrow a = 0, a = 3, a = 128`

     :math:`\therefore 0\le a \le 3`
305. This problem is similar to 226 and can be solved similarly.
306. :math:`f'(x) = 5(x - 1)^4 + 7(x + 2)^6 + 9(7x - 5)^8` can never be zero for any real value of :math:`x` therefore
     the given equation can have only one real real root at maximum.
307. Let :math:`x + 2 = t^2` then :math:`\sqrt{2(t^2 + 1)} - t = 3 \Rightarrow 2t^2 + 2 = 9 + 6t + t^2`

     :math:`\Rightarrow t = 7, -1`

     Now it is trivial to calculate the values. 308 through 317 have been left as exercises.

318. :math:`\sum_{i = 1}^n(x - a_i)^2 -\= nx^2 - 2(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)x + (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)`

     This is a quadratic equation in :math:`x` and coefficient of :math:`x^2` is :math:`n > 0,` therefore this quadratic
     equation will have least value at :math:`x = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{n}`
319. Let the quotient be :math:`\frac{n}{n^2 - 1},` where :math:`n` is a natural number.

     According to question,

     :math:`\frac{n + 2}{n^2 - 1 + 2} > \frac{1}{3 \Rightarrow n^2 - 3n - 5 < 0}`

     :math:`\Rightarrow \frac{3}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{29}}{2} < n < \frac{3}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{29}}{2}`

     Also, :math:`0 < \frac{n - 3}{n^2 - 1 - 3} < \frac{1}{10}`

     :math:`\Rightarrow -2 < n < 2` or :math:`3 < n < \infty` or :math:`n > 2`

     :math:`n = 4` is the only natural number satisfying all the conditions. Therefore, quotient is
     :math:`\frac{4}{15}.`
320. Let :math:`f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c` then :math:`g(x) = ax^2 + (2a + b)x + c + b + 2a`

     Given, :math:`ax^2 + bx + c > 0` for all :math:`x` :math:`\therefore b^2 - 4ac < 0` and :math:`a > 0`

     Discriminant of :math:`g(x) = 0`

     :math:`D = (b + 2a)^2 - 4a(c + b + 2a) = b^2 - 4ac - 4a^2 < 0` and :math:`a > 0`

     Hence, :math:`g(x) > 0` for all :math:`x.`
321. Clearly, :math:`f(x) \ge 0` for all :math:`x` then :math:`D \le 0` because coefficient of :math:`x^2` is positive.

     :math:`4(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \le 4(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2)`

     Hence, proven.
322.
