Arithmetic Progression Solutions
********************************
1. First term of the sequence is :math:`t_1 = 1^2 + 4 = 5.` Second term of the
   sequence is :math:`t_2 = 2^2 + 4 = 8.` Similarly third term is :math:`t_3 =
   3^2 + 4 = 13.` Difference between first two is 8 - 5 = 3 and thee difference
   between last two is 13 - 8 = 5. Since the differences are not equal so the
   sequence is not an A.P.

2. :math:`t_3 = t_1 + t_2 = 3 + 5 = 8.`

   :math:`t_4 = t_2 + t_3 = 8 + 5 = 13.`

   :math:`t_5 = t_3 + t_4 = 13 + 8 = 21.`

3. Clearly, common difference = d = 9 - 2 = 7. No. of terms = :math:`\frac{93 -
   2}{7} + 1 = 14.`

4. The first series is 2, 4, 6, ..., 200 for 100 terms and second series is 3,
   6, 9, ..., 240 for 80 terms. Clearly, first common term is 6 and common
   difference is also 6 which is least common multiple of 6. So common terms
   are 6, 12, 18, ..., 198. So total no. of identical terms are
   :math:`\frac{198 - 6}{6} + 1 = 33.`

5. (i) :math:`t_1 = 4, t_2 = 7, t_3 = 10, ...`
   (ii) .. math::
          t_1 = \frac{1}{2}, t_2 = \frac{2}{3}, t_3 = \frac{3}{4}, ...
   (iii) .. math::
           t_1 = \frac{1}{2}, t_2 = \frac{4}{3}, t_4 = \frac{10}{3}, ...

6. :math:`t_1 = 2a + b, t_2 = 4a + b.` Common difference = :math:`d = t_n -
   t-{n - 1} = 2a.` Since common term is independent of n and is a constant
   therefore the sequence is in A.P.

7. :math:`t_7 = a + 6d \because c.d. = -1 - (-4) = 3 \text{ and } a = -4 t_7
   = -4 + 18 = 14.`

8. The first 3 digit no. divisible by 7 is 105. Then we can find remaining by
   addding 7 to them. So the sequence is 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147,
   154, ..., 994.

9. Let first term is a and common difference is d. Given 7th term is 34 and
   12th term is 64. So :math:`a + 6d = 34` and :math:`a + 11d = 64.` So
   :math:`d = 6.` Therefore :math:`a = -2.` So 10th term is :math:`-2 + 9*6 =
   52.`

10. This problem is similar to 4 and is left as an exercise.

11. Let the terms are :math:`a - d, a, a + d.` Sum is 15 so :math:`a = 5.`

    Sum of squares is 83. Therefore :math:`3a^2 + 2d^2 = 83 \Rightarrow d = \pm
    2.` So the terms are :math:`3, 5, 7` or :math:`7, 5, 3.`

12 and 13 are similar to 11 and is left as exercises.

14.
