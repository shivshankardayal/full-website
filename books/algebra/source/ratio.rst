Ratio
*****
We will study ratios in this chapter. Many of you might already be knowing
about ratios from earlier classes. A ratio is nothing but a comparison between
two quantities of same kine. For example, 4 balls vs 7 balls or 12 shoes vs
8 shoes.

A ratio beween two qualtities :math:`Q1` and :math:`Q2` is written as
:math:`Q1:Q2` most of the time. :math:`Q1` or the first term is called the
**antecedent** and the :math:`Q2` or the second term is called the
**consequent**.

To measure the ratio between two quantities typically we use fractions. A
reduced fraction is tells us about one quanity being multiples of another or
part of that. For example, 2 dozen bananas compared to 6 bananas can be written
as :math:`\frac{2*12}{6}` or 4.

Ratios are *abstract quantities* because they are sheer numbers. In practice,
considering our previous example we can say 2 dozen banans are four times 6
bananas. This four is an abstract quantity because it does not have a physical
form.

Clearly, you can see that

.. math::

  \frac{Q1}{Q1} = \frac{mQ1}{mQ2}

so the ratio does not change if numerator or antecedent and denominator or
consequent are multiplied by the same quantity.

Comparing Two Ratios
====================
To compare two ratios we need to make their denominator same the we can deduce
if they are equal or unequal. For example consider two ratios :math:`r1:r2` and
:math:`r3r4`. Then we can have

.. math::

  \frac{r1}{r2} = \frac{r1r4}{r2r4} ~~\&~~ \frac{r3}{r4} = \frac{r3r2}{r2r4}

Now since consequent is same for both the ratios we can determine which ratio
is bigger or equal or smaller by determining if :math:`r1r4` is bigger or
equal or smaller as compared to :math:`r2r3`.

Ratio of Ratios
===============
Clearly, a ratio can be represented by a fraction of two integers. Now let us
try to see what happens to ratio of two ratios:

Consider two ratios: :math:`a:b` and math:`c:d`. Thus we can write ratio of
these two raios as fraction

.. math::
  \frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}} ~~or~~ \frac{ad}{bc}

Therefore we can conclude that it is eqauivalent to :math:`ad:bc`.

Surds and Ratios
================
When I said a ratio can be applied as a fraction of two integers then that
applied to finite numbers. A *surd* like :math:`\sqrt{x}` is not a finite
number because certain portion of its fractional part if recurring.
Therefore, when a surd if involved a ratio cannot be represented as a fraction
of two integers.

When we can represent a ratio *exactly* by two integers the quantities are
called **commensurable** else they are called **incommensurable**.

Compounding Ratios
==================
Ratios are compounded by multiplying ratios. The multiplication is done in
simple fashion. Antecedents with antecedents and consequents with consequents.

For example, consider some ratios: :math:`a:b`, :math:`c:d` and :math:`e:f`.
The compounded ratio is :math:`abc:def`.

Duplicating Ratios
==================
When a ratio is compounded with itself once it is called **duplicate ratio**.
If it is compunded twice then it is called **triplicate ratio**. If a square
root is taken then it is called **subduplicate ratio**.

Antecedent vs Consequent
========================
A ratio is of *greater inequality*, or *less inequality* or of *equality*
depending on whether antecedent is greater or smaller or equal to the
consequent.
