*****************************************
51. Ten thousands place can be filled in :math:`4` ways using :math:`1, 2, 3, 4`
    because if we put :math:`0` at that place then it will become a :math:`4`
    digit number.

    Rest of the :math:`4` places can be filled in :math:`^4P_4` i.e. :math:`24`
    ways.

    Thus total no. of :math:`5` digit numbers :math:`= 96`
52. Total no. of such numbers :math:`= 7\times 6\times 5 = 210` as hundred's
    place can be filled in :math:`7` ways, ten's place can be filled in
    :math:`6` remaining ways and unit's position can be filled in :math:`5`
    remaining ways.
53. Hundred's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways with any digit occupying
    that place except :math:`0`. Ten's place can also be filled in :math:`5`
    ways with remaining :math:`5` digits and unit's place can be filled in
    :math:`4` ways.

    Thus, desired number :math:`= 5\times 5\times 4 = 100`
54. Leftmost place can be filled in :math:`9` ways with the exception of
    :math:`0` not occupying that place. Rest of the places can be filled using
    :math:`9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2` ways using rest of the remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of such numbers :math:`= 9\times 9!`
55. Thousand's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways with :math:`0` not
    occupying that place. Rest of the places can be filled in :math:`5, 4, 3`
    ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 5\times 5\times 4\times 3 = 300`
56. Thousand's place can be filled only by :math:`5` and :math:`9` making it
    :math:`2` ways to fill that place. Rest of the places can be filled in
    :math:`3, 2, 1` ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 2\times 3\times 2 = 12`
57. **Case I:** When the number is of three digits.

    Hundred's place can be filled by :math:`3, 4, 5` in three ways. Rest two
    places can be filled in :math:`5` and :math:`4` ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of three digit numbers :math:`= 3\times 5\times 4 = 60`

    **Case II:** When the number is of four digits.

    Thousand's place can be filled by :math:`1, 2, 3` in three ways. Rest of the
    three places can be filled in :math:`5, 4, 3` ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 3\times 5\times 4\times3 = 180`

    Therefore, desired answer :math:`= 60 + 180 = 240`
58. For the number to be divisible by :math:`5` unit's place has to either
    :math:`0` or :math:`5`.

    **Case I:** When :math:`0` occurs at units place.

    Ten thousand's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways, thousand's place in
    :math:`4` ways and so on.

    Thus total no. of such numbers :math:`= 5\times 4\times 3\times 2 = 120`

    **Case II:** When :math:`5` occurs at units place.

    Ten thousand's place can be filled in :math:`3` ways as :math:`0` cannot
    occupy that position. Rest of the place can be filled in :math:`3, 2, 1`
    ways with remaining digits.

    Thus total no. of such numbers :math:`= 3\times 3\times 2 = 18`

    Desired answer :math:`= 120 + 18 = 138`
59. Total no. of six digits number :math:`= 6! = 720`

    For the number to be not divisible by :math:`5` unit's place must not be
    :math:`5`. Thus, unit's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways. Rest of the
    places can be filled in :math:`5!` or :math:`120` ways. Thus, no. of
    numbers not divisible by :math:`5 = 5\times5! = 600`
60. For the number to be even unit's place must be occupied by :math:`2` and
    :math:`4`. Rest of the :math:`4` remaining places can be filled in
    :math:`4!` ways. Thus, total no. of such numbers :math:`= 4.4! = 96`
61. **Case I:** When the number is of one digit.

    Only :math:`5` is one positive integer divisible by :math:`5`.

    **Case II:** When the number is of two digits.

    Unit's place must be occupied by :math:`0` or :math:`5` making it possible
    to fill unit's place in :math:`1` way each.

    Ten's place can be filled in :math:`8` ways or :math:`9` ways with
    remaining depending on what is at unit's place.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 8 + 9 = 17`

    **Case III:** When the number is of three digits.

    When :math:`0` occupies unit's place, hundred's and ten's places can be
    filled in :math:`9` and :math:`8` ways respectively.

    When :math:`5` occupies unit's place, hundred's and ten's places can be
    filled in :math:`8` and :math:`8` ways respectively.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 9\times 8 + 8\times 8 = 136`

    Desired no. :math:`= 1 + 17 + 136 = 154`
62. Hundred's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways as :math:`0` cannot occupy
    that place. Then, ten's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways and unit's
    place can be filled in :math:`4` ways.

    Total no. of numbers :math:`= 5\times 5\times 4 = 100`

    For the numbers to be odd unit's place has to be filled using :math:`5` or
    :math:`7` making it :math:`2` ways.

    Then, hundred's position can be filled in :math:`4` ways and ten's place
    in :math:`4` ways.

    Thus total no. of odd numbers :math:`= 4\times 4\times 2 = 32`
63. **Case I:** When the no. is of one digit.

    Even numbers would be :math:`0, 2, 4`.

    **Case II:** When the no. is of two digits.

    When unit's place occupies :math:`0` ten's place can be filled in :math:`4`
    ways. If unit's place occupied :math:`2` or :math:`4` ten's place can be
    filled in :math:`3` ways.

    Thus total no. of numbers :math:`= 4 + 3 + 3`

    Similarly, rest of the problem can be solved and has been left as exercise.
64. If :math:`5` always occupies ten's place then rest of the :math:`5`
    positions can be filled using remaining :math:`5` digits in :math:`5!` i.e.
    :math:`120` ways.
65. Let us solved both of sub-questions.

    i. Number of four digit numbers :math:`= ^7P_4 = 840`

    ii. **Case I:** When the thousand's place is :math:`3`.

        Hundred's place can be filled in :math:`4` ways using :math:`4, 5, 6, 7`

        Ten's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways with :math:`5` remaining
        digits.

        Unit's place can be filled in :math:`4` ways.

        Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 4\times 5\times 4 = 80`

        **Case II:** When the thousand's place contains :math:`4, 5, 6, 7`

        Remaining places can be filled in :math:`6, 5, 4` ways with remaining
        digits.

        Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 4\times 6\times 5\times 4`

        :math:`= 480`

        Thus, total no. of numbers greater than :math:`3400 = 80 + 480 = 560`
66. Since thousand's and unit's place digits are fixed rest two positions can be
    filled in :math:`3` and :math:`2` ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of such numbers :math:`= 3\times 2 = 6`

Problem no. 67, 68, 69 and 70 are left as exercises.

71. Ten thousand's place cannot be occupied by :math:`0`.

    When :math:`2` occurs at ten thousand's place, no. of numbers :math:`^4P_4 =
    24`

    When :math:`2` occurs at hundred's, ten's or unit's place, no. of numbers
    :math:`= 3\times 3\times 2 = 18`

    :math:`\therefore` Sum of numbers :math:`= 24(2 + 4 + 6 + 8)\times 10000 +
    18(2 + 4 + 6 + 8)\times 1000 + 18(2 + 4 + 6 + 8)\times 100` :math:`+
    18(2 + 4 + 6 + 8)\times 10 + 18(2 + 4 + 6 + 8)\times 1`

    :math:`= 5199960`

Problem no. 72 and 73 have been left as exercises.

76. Each thing can be given in :math:`p` ways. Thus, :math:`n` things can be
    given in :math:`p^n` ways.
77. Each monkey can have :math:`m` masters. Thus, :math:`n` monkeys can have
    :math:`n^m` masters.
78. :math:`2` prized in Mathematics and Physics can be given in :math:`2^{10}`
    ways each. :math:`1` prize in Chemistry can be given in :math:`10` ways.

    Thus, total no. of ways :math:`= 2^{10} + 2^{10} + 10 = 2058`
79. :math:`12` cows can be loaded in :math:`12^{12}` ways.

    :math:`12` calves can be loaded in :math:`12^{12}` ways.

    :math:`12` horses can be loaded in :math:`12^{12}` ways.

    Thus, total no. of ways :math:`= 3\times 12^{12}`
80. Each delegate can be put in :math:`6` different ways.

    Thus, :math:`5` delegates can be put in :math:`6^5` ways.
81. Ten thousand's place can be filled in :math:`4` ways. Rest of the places
    can be filled in :math:`5` ways.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 4\times 5^4`
82. Each ring can be had in :math:`4` fingers.

    :math:`6` rings can be had in :math:`4^6` ways.
83. Thousand's place can be filled using :math:`3, 4, 5` i.e. :math:`3` ways.

    Rest of the places can be filled in :math:`6` ways each using any of the

    If no consecutive questions to be answered in same way then first question
    can be answered in :math:`4` ways while rest can be answered in :math:`3`
    ways. Thus, total no. of answers :math:`= 4\times 3^9`
86. Treating all volumes as one book we have four books, which can be arranged
    in :math:`4!` ways. But books with three volumes can be arranged in
    :math:`3!` ways among themselves and books with two volumes can be arranged
    in :math:`2!` ways.
