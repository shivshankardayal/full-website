51. Ten thousands place can be filled in :math:`4` ways using :math:`1, 2, 3, 4`
    because if we put :math:`0` at that place then it will become a :math:`4`
    digit number.

    Rest of the :math:`4` places can be filled in :math:`^4P_4` i.e. :math:`24`
    ways.

    Thus total no. of :math:`5` digit numbers :math:`= 96`
52. Total no. of such numbers :math:`= 7\times 6\times 5 = 210` as hundred's
    place can be filled in :math:`7` ways, ten's place can be filled in
    :math:`6` remaining ways and unit's position can be filled in :math:`5`
    remaining ways.
53. Hundred's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways with any digit occupying
    that place except :math:`0`. Ten's place can also be filled in :math:`5`
    ways with remaining :math:`5` digits and unit's place can be filled in
    :math:`4` ways.

    Thus, desired number :math:`= 5\times 5\times 4 = 100`
54. Leftmost place can be filled in :math:`9` ways with the exception of
    :math:`0` not occupying that place. Rest of the places can be filled using
    :math:`9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2` ways using rest of the remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of such numbers :math:`= 9\times 9!`
55. Thousand's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways with :math:`0` not
    occupying that place. Rest of the places can be filled in :math:`5, 4, 3`
    ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 5\times 5\times 4\times 3 = 300`
56. Thousand's place can be filled only by :math:`5` and :math:`9` making it
    :math:`2` ways to fill that place. Rest of the places can be filled in
    :math:`3, 2, 1` ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 2\times 3\times 2 = 12`
57. **Case I:** When the number is of three digits.

    Hundred's place can be filled by :math:`3, 4, 5` in three ways. Rest two
    places can be filled in :math:`5` and :math:`4` ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of three digit numbers :math:`= 3\times 5\times 4 = 60`

    **Case II:** When the number is of four digits.

    Thousand's place can be filled by :math:`1, 2, 3` in three ways. Rest of the
    three places can be filled in :math:`5, 4, 3` ways with remaining digits.

    Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 3\times 5\times 4\times3 = 180`

    Therefore, desired answer :math:`= 60 + 180 = 240`
58. For the number to be divisible by :math:`5` unit's place has to either
    :math:`0` or :math:`5`.

    **Case I:** When :math:`0` occurs at units place.

    Ten thousand's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways, thousand's place in
    :math:`4` ways and so on.

    Thus total no. of such numbers :math:`= 5\times 4\times 3\times 2 = 120`

    **Case II:** When :math:`5` occurs at units place.

    Ten thousand's place can be filled in :math:`3` ways as :math:`0` cannot
    occupy that position. Rest of the place can be filled in :math:`3, 2, 1`
    ways with remaining digits.

    Thus total no. of such numbers :math:`= 3\times 3\times 2 = 18`

    Desired answer :math:`= 120 + 18 = 138`
59. Total no. of six digits number :math:`= 6! = 720`

    For the number to be not divisible by :math:`5` unit's place must not be
    :math:`5`. Thus, unit's place can be filled in :math:`5` ways. Rest of the
    places can be filled in :math:`5!` or :math:`120` ways. Thus, no. of
    numbers not divisible by :math:`5 = 5\times5! = 600`
60. For the number to be even unit's place must be occupied by :math:`2` and
    :math:`4`. Rest of the :math:`4` remaining places can be filled in
    :math:`4!` ways. Thus, total no. of such numbers :math:`= 4.4! = 96`
