Solutions for Ratios
********************
1. We have :math:`4:7` and :math:`11:5`. Therefore, ratio of these two ratios
is

.. math::
  \frac{4}{7}*\frac{5}{11}=\frac{20}{77}.

2. For :math:`13:24` and :math:`34:23` we have their ratio as

.. math::
  \frac{13}{24}*\frac{23}{34}=\frac{299}{816}.

3. a. For these two we make their denominators equal. We multiply and divide
   first by 6 and second by 5 then we have

.. math::
  \frac{4}{5}*\frac{6}{6} = \frac{24}{30}

and

.. math::
  \frac{5}{6}*\frac{5}{5} = \frac{25}{30}

Therefore, :math:`5:6` is greater.

   b. Similarly, as in previous case

.. math::
  \frac{34}{33}*\frac{67}{67} = \frac{2278}{2211}

and

.. math::
  \frac{68}{67}*\frac{33}{33} = \frac{2244}{2211}

Clearly, :math:`34:33` is greater.
