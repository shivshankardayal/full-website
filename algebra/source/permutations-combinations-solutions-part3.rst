Permutations and Combinations Solutions Part 3
**********************************************
101. The word "Independence" has :math:`12` letters with :math:`3` ns, :math:`2`
     ds, :math:`4` es and one each of i, p and c.

     Thus, total no. of permutations possible :math:`= \frac{12!}{3!2!4!}`
102. The word "Principal" has :math:`9` letters with:math:`2` ps, :math:`2` is,
     and one each of r, n, c, a and l.

     Taking all three vowels together as one total no. of permutation is

     :math:`\frac{7!}{2!}` but the vowels themselves can be arranged in
     :math:`\frac{3!}{2!}` ways.

     :math:`\therefore` desired answer :math:`= \frac{7!3!}{2!2!}`
103. Mathematics has :math:`11` letters with m coming twice, a coming twice,
     t coming twice, h, e, t, i, c, s each coming once.

     Therefore, total no. of words that can be formed using these
     :math:`= \frac{11!}{2!2!}`

     Treating vowels and consonants together no. of words that can be formed
     :math:`= 2!. \frac{8!3!}{2!2!2!}`

     That is because :math:`8` consonants can be arranged in
     :math:`\frac{8!}{2!2!}` ways.

     :math:`3` vowels can be arranged in :math:`\frac{3!}{2!}` ways.

     Finally, the consonants and vowels can be arranged in :math:`2!` ways
     when taken together.
104. The word "Director" has :math:`8` letters with only :math:`r` repeating
     for :math:`2` times. Taking three vowels as one we can arrange them in
     :math:`\frac{6!}{2!}` ways but three vowels can be arranged in :math:`3!`
     ways among themselves.

     Thus, desired answer :math:`= \frac{3!6!}{2!}`
105. The word "Plantain" has :math:`8` letters with a and n repeating :math:`2`
     times each. Treating all vowels as one word we have total no. of
     arrangements as :math:`\frac{6!}{2!}` but :math:`3` vowels can be
     arranged in :math:`\frac{3!}{2!}` ways among themselves.

     Thus, desired answer :math:`= \frac{3!6!}{2!2!}`
106. The word "Intermediate" has :math:`12` letters with i coming twice, t
     coming twice, e coming thrice, n, r, m, d, a coming once.

     So we have :math:`6` consonants and :math:`6` vowels.

     Sinec the relative order does not change consonants will occupy consonants
     place and vowels will occupy vowels place.

     Therefore, total no. of desired words :math:`= \frac{6!6!}{2!2!3!}`
107. The word "Parallel" has :math:`8` letters with l coming thrice, a coming
     twice, p, r, e each coming once.

     Thus, total no. of arrangements :math:`= \frac{8!}{3!2!}`

     Treating all l as one; no. of numbers when all l come together
     :math:`= \frac{6!}{2!3!}`

     :math:`\therefore` Desired answer :math:`= \frac{8!}{3!2!} -
     \frac{6!}{2!31}`
108. Let us solve for each case one by one.

     i. In this case position of D is fixed. So, remaining :math:`4` letters
        can be arranged in :math:`4!` ways as there is no repetition.
     ii. Same as previous case :math:`4!` is the answer.
     iii. Same as previous case :math:`4!` is the answer.
     iv. In this case position of two letters is fixed so answer is :math:`3!`
109. The word "violent" has :math:`7` letters. If vowels are to occupy all
     odd places then :math:`4` consonants can be arranged in :math:`4!` ways
     and vowels can be arranged in :math:`3!` ways.

     Thus, desired answer :math:`= 4!3!`
110. The word :math:`Saloon` has :math:`6` letters with o repeating twice.

     Since, vowels and consonants occupy alternate places total no. of such
     words :math:`= 2\frac{3!3!}{2!}` as :math:`3` consonants can be arranged in
     :math:`3!` ways for :math:`3 places` and vowels can be arranged in
     :math:`\frac{3!}{2!}` ways. But then odd positions and even positions
     can be swapped doubling the no. of words formed.
111. The word :math:`Article` has :math:`7` letters with no repetitions.

     Following as 109 total no. of such words :math:`= 4!3!`
112. Since the number has to be greater than :math:`4` million the most
     significant place can be occupied by either :math:`4` or :math:`5`

     **Case I:** When most significant digit is :math:`4`

     Rest of the digits can arrnaged in :math:`\frac{6!}{2!2!}` ways as both
     :math:`3` and :math:`5` repeat twice.

     **Case II:** When most significant digit is :math:`5`

     Total no. of numbers :math:`= \frac{6!}{2!}`

     Therefore, desired answer :math:`= \frac{6!}{2!2!} + \frac{6!}{2!}`

113. Total no. of numbers :math:`= \frac{7!}{3!2!}` as :math:`2` repeats thrice
     and :math:`3` repeats twice.

     For the no. of be odd unit's place must be occupied by one of :math:`1,
     3, 5`.

     **Case I:** When unit's place is occupied by :math:`1` or :math:`5`

     Total no. of numbers :math:`= 2 \frac{6!}{3!2!}`

     **Case II:** When unit's place is occupied by :math:`3`

     Total no. of numbers :math:`= \frac{6!}{3!}`

     Now total no. of odd numbers is sum of these two cases.
114. There are four odd places with :math:`4` odd digits with both :math:`1`
     and :math:`3` reapeting twice.

     Also, there are three even places with :math:`2` repeating twice and
     :math:`4` coming only once.

     Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= \frac{4!}{2!2!}\frac{3!}{2!}`
115. **Case I:** When :math:`1` occurs at most significant place and the number
     is of :math:`5` digits.

     Remaining :math:`4` positions can be filled in :math:`^5P_4` ways.

     **Case II:** When :math:`1` occurs at most significant place and the number
     is of :math:`6` digits.

     Remaining :math:`5` positions can be filled in :math:`^5P_5` ways.

     **Case III:** When one of :math:`2, 3, 4, 5` occurs at most significant
     place and the number is of :math:`5` digits.

     Remaining :math:`4` positions can be filled in :math:`\frac{^5P_4}{2!}`
     ways.

     Thus, total no. of such numbers :math:`= 4.\frac{^5P_4}{2!}`

     **Case IV:** When one of :math:`2, 3, 4, 5` occurs at most significant
     place and the number is of :math:`6` digits.

     Remaining :math:`5` positions can be filled in :math:`\frac{5!}{2!}` ways.

     Thus, total no. of such numbers :math:`= 4.\frac{5!}{2!}`

     Desired answer is sum of these.
116. Most significant place can be filled using one of :math:`1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
     i.e. in :math:`5` ways. Rest of the places can be filled in :math:`6` ways.

     Thus, total no. of four digit numbers :math:`= 5\times 6^3`

     Total no. of four digit numbers without any digit repeating :math:`=
     5\times 5\times 4\times 3`

     The difference of these two is the no. of numbers where at least one digit
     repeats.
117. Total no. of signals :math:`= \frac{9!}{5!2!2!}`
118. Total no. of signals :math:`= ^6P_1 +~^6P_2 +~^6P_3 +~^6P_4 +~^6P_5
     +~^6P_6`
119. Total no. of arrangements :math:`= 5!`. In half of these :math:`e` will
     come before :math:`i`.
120. :math:`4!`
121. Let us solve each case:

     i. :math:`9!` because there is no restriction from the formula for
        circular permutation.
     ii. Let us first fix position of boys. They can be seated in :math:`4!`
         ways from the formula of circular permutation.

         This will make :math:`5` empty seats between boys and girls can be
         seated in :math:`^5P_5` ways.

         Therefore, total no. :math:`= 4!5!`
122. Treating all girls as a single entity total no. of seating arrangements
     :math:`= 6!` from the formula of circular permutation as there will be
     :math:`7` entities to be seated.

     But the :math:`4` girls can be seated in :math:`4!` ways among themselves.

     Thus, total no. of numbers :math:`= 6!4!`
123. If the line starts with a girl then total no. of ways :math:`= 5!5!`

     If the line starts with a boy then total no. of ways :math:`= 5!5!`

     Thus, total no. of ways :math:`= 2.5!5!`

     **Second Part:** First let us make the boys take up places. So :math:`5`
     boys can be arranged in :math:`4!` ways. Now :math:`5` girls can be
     seated in :math:`5` empty seats in :math:`5!` ways.

     Thus, total no. of seating arrangements :math:`= 4!5!`
124. Following as last problem, total no. of ways :math:`= 5!\times~^6P_5`
125. Since clockwise or anti-clockwise arrangement does not matter in a necklace
     total no. of ways :math:`= \frac{49!}{2}`
126. Treating two particular delegated and host as one person we have :math:`19`
     persons.

     Total no. of ways of seating :math:`19` persons around a round table
     :math:`= 18!`

     But the delegated and host can be arranged in :math:`2!` ways as two
     delegated sit on either side of host.

     Thus, total no. of desired arrangements :math:`= 18!2!`
127. Four gentlemen can be seated in :math:`3!` ways. This will make :math:`4`
     empty seats between gentlemen so that no two ladies sit together.

     No. of ways of making ladies sit in these :math:`4` positions :math:`= 4!`

     Thus, total no. of arrangements :math:`= 3!4!`
128. Following as previous problem; total no. of arrangements :math:`= 6!~^7P_6`
129. We know that if :math:`^nC_x =~^nC_y` then either :math:`x = y` or
     :math:`x + y = n`

     :math:`\therefore` Either :math:`3r = r+3\Rightarrow r = \frac{3}{2}`
     which is not possible as :math:`r` is an integer.

     :math:`\therefore 3r + r + 3 = 15 \Rightarrow r = 3`
130. :math:`^nC_6:^{n - 3}C_3 = 33:4`

     :math:`\therefore \frac{n!}{6!(n-6)!}\times\frac{3!(n - 3 - 3)}{(n-3)!} =
     \frac{33}{4}`

     :math:`\therefore \frac{n!}{(n - 3!)}.\frac{3!}{6!} = \frac{33}{4}`

     :math:`n(n - 1)(n - 2) = 6.5.33 = 11.10.9`

     :math:`n = 11`
131. Given expression is :math:`^{47}C_4 + (^{51}C_3 + ^{50}C_3 + ^{49}C_3 +
     ^{48}C_3 + ^{47}C_3)`

     :math:`= ^{48C_4} + (^{51}C_3 + ^{50}C_3 + ^{49}C_3 +  ^{48}C_3) [\because
     ^{47C_4 + ^{47}C_3} = ^{48}C_4]`

     Following similarly, :math:`= ^{52}C_4`
132. Let :math:`p` be the product of :math:`r` consecutive integers beginning
     with :math:`n`

     Then :math:`p = n(n + 1)(n + 2) \ldots (n + r - 1)`

     :math:`\frac{p}{r!} = \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2) \ldots (n + r - 1)}{r!}`

     :math:`= ^{n + r - 1}C_r`

     :math:`= ` number of combinations of :math:`n + r - 1` things taken
     :math:`r` at a time = an integer

     Therefore, product is divisible by :math:`r!`
133. Total no. of triangles formed :math:`= ^mC_3`
134. Total no. of ways of choosing :math:`3` children out of :math:`8 = ^8C_3
     = 56`

     Therefore, the man will have to go to zoo for :math:`56` times.

     **Second Part:** Choosing :math:`3` children out of :math:`8` when a
     particular child is always chosen :math:`= ^1C_1.^7C_2 = 21`
135. Choosing a pair of students out of :math:`n = ^nC_2`

     Total no. of cards sent by one pair :math:`= 2`

     Therefore, total no. of cards send :math:`= 2.^nC_2 = 600`

     :math:`n^2 - n - 600 = 0`

     :math:`n = -24, 25`

     But :math:`n` cannot be negative. Thus, :math:`n = 25`
136. Whenever two vertices are joined either a diagonal or a side is formed.

     Total no. of diagonals and sides :math:`= ^mC_2`

     But out of these :math:`m` will be sides.

     Therefore, no. of diagonals :math:`= ^mC_2 - m = \frac{m(m - 1)}{2} - m`

     :math:`= \frac{m(m - 3)}{2}`
137. Total no. of persons :math:`= 10`

     Choosing :math:`5` persons out of :math:`10 = ^{10}C_5`

     Choosing :math:`5` persons out of :math:`6` men :math:`= ^6C_5`

     Thus, no. of committees where at least one women is selected :math:`=
     ^10C_5 - ^6C_5`
138. Let us solve these one by one:

     i. Total no. of selections of :math:`3` points out of :math:`10 = ^{10}C_3`

        Total no. of selection of :math:`4` points out of :math:`4` collinear
        points :math:`= ^4C_3`

        Thus, no. of triangles formed :math:`= ^{10}C_3 - ^4C_3`

     ii. Total no. of selections of :math:`2` points out of :math:`10` points
         :math:`= ^{10}C_2 = 45`

         Number of selections of two points when only one straight line is
         formed :math:`= ^4C_2 = 6`

         i.e. the two points are selected from :math:`4` collinear points making
         the straight line only one.

         Therefore, total no. of straight lines :math:`= 45 - 6 + 1 = 40`
     iii. Total no. of selections of :math:`4` points out of :math:`10 =
          ^{10}C_4 = 210`

          Number of selections when no quadrilateral is formed :math:`=
          ^4C_3.^6C_1 + ^4C_4.6C_0 = 25`

          Thus, total no. of quadrilaterals formed :math:`= 210 - 25 = 185`
139. **Case I:** When fruits of same type are different.

     Number of selections :math:`= (^4C_0 + ^4C_1 + \ldots + ^4C_4)`
     :math:`(^5C_0 + ^5C_1 + \ldots + ^5C_5)(^6C_0 + ^6C_1 + \ldots + ^6C_6)
     - 1`

     :math:`= 2^4.2^5.2^6 - 1 = 2^15 - 1`
     **Case I:** When fruits of same type are same.

     Zero or more oranges can be selected in :math:`5` ways.

     Zero or more apples can be selected in :math:`6` ways.

     Zero or more mangoes can be selected in :math:`7` ways.

     Thus, total no. of ways :math:`= 5.6.7 = 210`

     But in one of these ways no fruit is selected, making answer :math:`209`.
140. Following case I of previous problem we have total no. of ways
     :math:`= (2^5 - 1).(2^4 - 1).2^3 - 1 = 3720`
141. Factors of :math:`21,600` are :math:`2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5`

     Thus, total no. of divisors :math:`= 6.4.3 - 1 = 71`

     Total no. of divisors including :math:`1 = 72`
142. No. of ways :math:`= ^5C_1 + ^5C_2 + ^5C_3 + ^5C_4 + ^5C_5 = 2^5 - 1 = 31`
143. Required number :math:`= ^{12}C_4.^8C_4.^4C_4`
144. Total no. of letters in the word "EXAMINATION" :math:`= 11` out of which
     A, N, I occur twice. Different letters are E, X, A, M, I, N, T, O which are
     eight in count.

     **Case I:** When all are different.

     Total no. of words formed :math:`= ^8C_4.4!`

     **Case II** When two are identical and two are different.

     There are three possibilities of identical letters with A, N, I each
     occurring twice.

     Total no. of words formed :math:`= 3.^7C_2.\frac{4!}{2!} = 756`

     **Case III:** When letters are pair of identical letters.

     Total no. of words formed :math:`= 3.\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 18`
145. :math:`\because 30 \neq 4; n = 30 + 4 = 34`
146. :math:`\because 12 \neq 8; n = 12 + 8 = 20`

     :math:`^{20}C_{17} = \frac{20.19.18}{3.2} = 1140`

     :math:`^{22}C_{20} = \frac{22.21}{2} = 231`
147. :math:`\because r \neq r + 2; r + r + 2 = 18 \Rightarrow r = 8`

     :math:`^8C_6 = 28`
148. :math:`n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) = 15.4.3.2`

     :math:`n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) = 6.5.4.3 \Rightarrow n = 6`
149. :math:`\frac{15!}{r!(15-r)!}.\frac{(r-1)!(16 - r)!}{15!} = 11:5`

     :math:`\Rightarrow r = 5`
150. :math:`r = 5`
