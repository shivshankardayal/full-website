<h1>1. Number System<a class="headerlink" href="#number-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we will study about number systems. We normally deal in
decimal number system. First question which will come to your mind is what is
a number system? Well, a number system is a system which determines the rules
and symbols for numbers on how we are going to use them. The symbols for
decimal number system are arabic but they were taken from India, presumably.
A number system consists of symbols for representing numbers and a dot for
representing fractional numbers. Minus sign is used to represent negative
numbers. A number system ranges from <span class="math">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math">\(+\infty\)</span>. It
is best represented by a straight line given below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../_images/tikz-4329ee2cbe8f864f41728c46c9769b68869adbc1.png" alt="\draw (0,0) -- (7,0);
\draw (3.5, -0.2) -- (3.5, 0.2);
\draw (3.5, 0.4) node {0};
\draw (0, 0.4) node {$-\infty$};
\draw (7, 0.4) node {$\infty$};
\draw (0, -0.2) -- (0, 0.2);
\draw (7, -0.2) -- (7, 0.2);" /></p>
<p class="caption">Number axis</p></div><p>As you see the stretch of number axis, it makes me wonder what is infinity.
Infinity in itself is not a number to be honest in the sense that it is more
of a concept. Infinity is such a large number that cannot be written or
achieved by anything of physical world. Infinity is immeasurable. Each point
on this axis represents a number. It may be integer or fractional number. I
hope you know what is an integer. An integer is a whole number like -1, -2,
0, 5, 7 etc. Real numbers have fractional parts like 1.234. I cannot go much
into these basics. The <strong>important fact</strong> to note is that between any two
points there exists infinite numbers. In other words between any two numbers
there exists infinite numbers. For example, between 1.2 and 1.3 there are
1.21, 1.22, 1.23..., 1.29. Moreover between 1.21 and 1.22 there are 1.211,
1.212, 1.213 and so on.</p>
<p>Now let us come back to number system discussion. It enables us to represent
a point on this axis. The numbers I have written are supposedly in decimal
number system. Base of decimal number system is 10. Why because it consists
of 10 distinct symbols 0 through 9. Similarly we can have any other number
system. Popular number systems in computers are binary, octal and hexadecimal
not to mention decimal ofcourse.</p>
<div class="section" id="definitions">
<h2>1.1. Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>1. <strong>Natural numbers</strong> Numbers 1, 2, 3 4, ... used in ordinary counting are
called natural numbers or positive integers. The set of natural numbers is
denoted by <strong>N</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}</p>
<p>2. <strong>Integers:</strong> The numbers ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... are
called integers. These are whole numbers i.e. not fractions. The set for
integers is denoted by <strong>I</strong> or <strong>Z</strong>.</p>
<p>This I or Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(N \subset Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Zero:</strong> 0 is an integer but a special integer. It is neither
negative not positive but 1&#8217;s complement in binary number system has two zero
one positive and one negative while 2&#8217;s complement has only one zero. Zero is
treated as a non-negative as well as non-positive integer.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>Set of positive integers = {1, 2,3, ...}</li>
<li>Set of negative integers = {-1, -2, -3, ...}</li>
<li>Set of non-negative integers = {0, 1, 2, ...}</li>
<li>Set of non-postive integers = {0, -1, -2, ...}</li>

<p class="caption">Integer Classification</p></div><p>4. <strong>Rational Numbers:</strong> is a number of form <span class="math">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> where <span class="math">\(a\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are integers and <span class="math">\(b\ne 0\)</span>. The set of rational numbers is
denoted by <strong>Q</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus Q= <span class="math">\(\{\frac{a}{b}: a,b\in Q \text{ and } b\ne 0\}\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(b\)</span>
is an integer it can very well be 1 therefore each number of the form
<span class="math">\(\frac{a}{1}\)</span> which is nothing but <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is also a rational number.</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(N\subset Z\subset Q\)</span>. Examples of rational numbers are
<span class="math">\(\frac{2}{3}, -\frac{3}{4}, 7\)</span> etc. 0 is an inetger and hence a rational
number.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Decimal form of a rational number is either recurring or terminating</strong> As
we know that base of decimal number system is 10 which has
two prime factors. Now if denominator of a rational number is not one and
contains any other factor than 2 and 5 then the rational number will be
recurring and if it is only product of powers of 2 and 5 or is 1 then the
rational number will be terminating. This can be generalized for any base or
radix <span class="math">\(r\)</span> which has say prime factors <span class="math">\(r_1, r_2, ..., r_n\)</span> then in
that case if denominator contains any other factor than these then that
rational number will be recurring else terminating.</p>
<p>For exmaple <span class="math">\(\frac{3}{4}=0.75\)</span> while
<span class="math">\(\frac{3}{7}=.4285714285714...\)</span></p>
<p>It is safe to assume that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> do not have a common factor
because that factor can be eliminated without changing the value of the
rational number.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Standard form of a rational number:</strong> A rational number of the
form <span class="math">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> is said to be in standard form if <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(b\)</span> have no factor in common other than 1 and <span class="math">\(b&gt;0\)</span>.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Irrational numbers:</strong> Consider a rational number
<span class="math">\(\frac{a}{b}=\sqrt{2}\)</span>. By definition of rational numbers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(b\)</span> cannot have a common factor. But then <span class="math">\(a,b\in Z\)</span> which is not
the case here as <span class="math">\(a \text{ or } b\)</span> is not an integer. Therefore, it is
not a rational number. The reason is if both of them are integers then the
rational number cannot be square root of a number. Hence, we can conclude that
this fraction <span class="math">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> is an irrational numbers and there are
infinite such irrational numbers.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Decimal form of an irational number is neither terminating nor
recurring</strong> For example :math:<cite>sqrt{5}=1.732...</cite></p>
<p>9. <strong>Real numbers:</strong> All rational and irrational numbers are also
known as real numbers which is denoted by set <strong>R</strong>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(N\subset Z\subset Q\subset R\)</span></p>

<div class="section" id="binary-number-system">
<h2>1.2. Binary Number System<a class="headerlink" href="#binary-number-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-0">As the name suggests binary number system has base of 2. Therefore it has
only two symbols. 0 and 1. This is the most popular system for computers
becasue TTL NAND and NOR gates which are the most basic logic gates using
which other gates are implemented in processor has only two voltage output
levels because of their operation in cut-off and saturation zones. These
terms are better understood with the help of a book on electronics which is
out of scope of this book. All binary numbers consist of 0 and 1. So the
count is like 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000 and so on.</p>
<div class="section" id="counting-in-binary-number-system">
<h3>1.2.1. Counting in Binary Number System<a class="headerlink" href="#counting-in-binary-number-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First 0 then 1 the what? Why 10? Because that is the next bigger number you
can form using 0 and 1. Also, 10 when converted to decimal is 2. This
represents base. 10 in any number system represents the base of that system.
After conversion to decimal. Note you can read it ten but it is not really
ten. There are no tens in binary. When you say ten by default we mean that of
decimal system. A number has no meaning without its base. So you can better
write it as <span class="math">\(10_2\)</span>. The subscript denotes the base.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conversion-of-decimal-and-binary">
<h3>1.2.2. Conversion of Decimal and Binary<a class="headerlink" href="#conversion-of-decimal-and-binary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Consider a decimal number. Let us say 53 then how would be convert it to
binary. The technique is that of division. Please watch following carefully:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>2 | 53 | 1
----------
2 | 26 | 0
----------
2 | 13 | 1
----------
2 | 6  | 0
----------
2 | 3  | 1
----------
2 | 1  |
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So the binary is <span class="math">\(110101_2\)</span>. Please allow me to explain the process
even though it is trivial and obvious. First we divide 53 by 2 and write
the remainder. Then quotient is 26. We repeat the process for 26 therefore
remainder is 0 and quotient is 13. This we go on repeatin till we have 1 as
quotient. Note that all the remainders will be 0 or 1 because divisor is 2.
Similarly, final quotient is always 1. Now we take final quotient and start
writing remainders from top to bottom.</p>
<p>To convert binary to decimal let us examine following:</p>
<div class="math">
\[1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 53_{10}\]</div>
<p>The power is to 2 because 2 is the base of source. It starts from 0 for unit&#8217;s
position and increases to 1 and 2 for ten&#8217;s and hundred&#8217;s position and so on.
1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s are the values of that place. If you note carefully powers of 2
grow like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and so on. Any number can be written
by using these powers at most one time. For example consider 100. I know it is
less than 128 so I will use 64. Then 36 remains. So I will use 32 and then 4.
This means <span class="math">\(100 = 64 + 32 + 4\)</span> which means power 6, 5 and 2 have been
used. Therefore, I can quickly write down number as <span class="math">\(1100100_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Fractional numbers are slightly more complicated. Let us consider
<span class="math">\(1.1_2\)</span>. In decimal it will be <span class="math">\(1 + \frac{1}{2}\)</span>. This is 1.5 in
decimal. Note that when you convert a fractional part of binary to decimal
denominator will always be power of 2. For that matter when you convert from
any base to decimal denominator will be powers of that base. <strong>Important</strong>
Therefore, when you convert from decimal to some base n then denominator of
that decimal number can have only those prime factors which are available in
the set of prime factors of n.</p>
<p>Operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
are similar in all number systems.</p>

<h2>1.3. A Generic Positional Number System<a class="headerlink" href="#a-generic-positional-number-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-1">Let us try to describe a number in a generic number system which is given
below:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-A generic positional number">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[\begin{split}(.. c_mb^{m-1} + c_{m-1}b^{m-2}+ ... + c_2b^1 + c1_b^0 + c_{-1}b^{-1} + ... + c_{-m}b^{-m} ) \\
= (... c_mc_{m-1}...c_2c_1.c_{-1}...c_{-m})_b\end{split}\]</div>
<p>As you can see all the terms with <span class="math">\(c\)</span> are called digits. The leftmost or
leading digit is called <em>most significant digit</em> and the rightmost or trailing
digit is called <em>least significant digit</em>. The . is called a point which
separates the integral part which is toards its left from the fractional part
which is towards its right. <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is known as radix or base of the number
system. Note that all digits will be between 0 to <span class="math">\(b-1\)</span>. So in our
decimal system <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is 10 therefore we have digits from 0 to 9. In binary
number system it is 2 therefore digits permitted are 0 and 1.</p>
<p>These are the basics of number systems i.e. the numbers themselves. When we
return back from our journey of Mathematics to Data structures and Algorithms
I will discuss more on number theory and about Alan Turing and how the world&#8217;s
shpae changed because of him and foundation of computer science was laid.</p>
