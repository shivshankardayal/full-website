<h1>4. Operators and Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#operators-and-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Operators and expressions are in the core of every programming language. They
form the major part of BNF grammar. They also decide how the syntax will look
like. You as a programmer will spend considerable time using C operators. C has
sevral type of operators like arithmetic operators, relational operators,
bitwise operators, unary operators, logical operators to name some of them.
Since C was first of very poopular structured general-pupose lnguages therefore
many modern language use almost all the operators and supplement with their own.
It is needless to say that to become a good programmar you must know all the
operators of C and know where to use which one as it may decide performance,
readability, simplicity of your code. Whenever you see array and pointer in
following sections just plow through them. All will be clear soon.</p>
<p>Whenever operators and expressions come in picture you may have a set of mixed
data then to perform opration data is converted from one type to another. This
is known as &#8220;Usual Arithmetic Conversion&#8221;, which I am going to tell you next.</p>
<div class="section" id="usual-arithmetic-conversions">
<span id="index-0"></span><h2>4.1. Usual Arithmetic Conversions<a class="headerlink" href="#usual-arithmetic-conversions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many operators that expect operands of arithmetic type cause conversions and
yield result types in a similar way. The purpose is to determine a common real
type for the operands and result. For the specified operands, each operand is
converted, without change of type domain, to a type whose corresponding real
type is the common real type. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the common
real type is alo the corresponding real type of the result, whose type domain is
the type domian of the operands if they are the same, and complex otherwise.
This pattern is called the usual <em>arithmetic convresions</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, if the corresponding real type of either operand is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">long</span> <span class="pre">double</span></tt>,
the other operand is converted, without change of type domain, to a type
whose coresponding real type is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">long</span> <span class="pre">double</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the corresponding real type of either operand is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">double</span></tt>, the
other operand is converted, without change of type domain, to a type whose
coreesponding real type is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">double</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the corresponding real type of either operand is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">float</span></tt>, the
other operand is converted, without change of type domain, to a type whose
coreesponding real type is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">float</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the integer promotions are performed on both operands. Then the
following rules are applied to the promoted operands:<ul>
<li>If both operands have the same type, then no further conversion is needed.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned
integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank
is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater
or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, then the operand with
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned
integer type.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type,
then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the
operand with signed integer type.</li>
<li>Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type
corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The values of floating operands and of the results of floating expressions may
be represented in greater precision and range than that required by the type;
the types are not changed thereby.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expressions">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>4.2. Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#expressions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Majority of this comes from specification n1124.pdf. It can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf</a>. An expression is a
sequence of operators and operands. This sequence of operators and operands will
lead to some computation; needless to say, however, it may designate an object
or a function or it may generate a side effect or a combination. The value
computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value
computation of the result of the operator.</p>
<p>Consider the following where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">++</span></tt> is used as prefix and postfix increment
unary operator, which should increment the value of operand after evaluating the
operand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>i = ++i + 1;</p>
<p>a[i++] = i;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>however, this is an undefined bahavior because if a side effect on a scalar
(all arithmetic and pointer types are scalar) object is unsequenced relative to
either a different side effect on the same scalar onject or a value computation
using the value of the same scalar object,  the behavior is undefined. If there
are multiple allowable orderings of the subexpression of an expression, the
behavior is undefined if such an unsequenced side effect occurs in any of the
orderings.</p>
<p>The groupings of operators and operands is indicated by the syntax. The syntax
specifies the precedence of operators in the evaluation, highest precedence
first. The table is given later. The exceptions are cast expressions as operands
of unary operators, and an operand contained between any of the following pairs
of operators: grouping parentheses (), subscripting brackets[], function call
parentheses (), and the conditional operator ?:. Except as specified later,
side effects and value computations of subexpressions are unsequenced. In an
expression that is evaluated more than once during the execution of a program,
unsequenced and indeterminately sequenced evaluations of its subexpressions
need not be performed consistently in different evaluations.</p>
<p>Some operators (the unary operator ~, and the binary operators &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &amp;, ^,
and |, collectively described as bitwise opearators) are required to have
operands that have integer types. These operators yield values that depend on
the internal representation of intergers, and have implementation-defined and
undefined aspects for signed types.</p>
<p>If an exceptional condition occurs during the evaluation of an expression (that
is, if the result is not mathematicslly defined or not in the range of
representable values for its type), the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p>The effective type of an object for an access to its stored value is the
declared type of the object, if any. Note that allocated objects have no
declared type. If a value is stored into an object having no declared type
through an lvalue (a value whose address can be taken) having a type that is not
a character type, then the type of the lvalue becomes the effective type of the
object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the stored
value. If a value is copied into an object having no declared type using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">memcpy</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">memmove</span></tt>, or is copied as an array of character type, then the
effective type of the modified object for that access and for subsequent
accesses that do not modify the value is the effective type of the object from
which the value is copied, if it has one. For all other accesses to an object
having no declared type, the effective type of the object is simply the type of
the lvalue used for the access.</p>
<p>An object will have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue expression that
has one of the following types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a type compatible with the effective type of the object,</li>
<li>a qualified version of a type compatible with the effective type of the
object,</li>
<li>a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the effective type
of the object,</li>
<li>a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a qualified</li>
<li>version of the effective type of the object,</li>
<li>an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among
its members (including, recursively, a member of a subaggregate or contained
union), or a character type.</li>
</ul>
<p>A floating expression may be contracted, that is, evaluated as though it were
an atomic operation, thereby omitting rounding errors implied by the source code
and the expression evaluation method. A contracted expression might also omit
raising of floating-point exceptions. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FP_CONTRACT</span></tt> pragma in provides a
way to disallow contracted expressions. Otherwise, whether and how expressions
are contracted is implementation-defined.</p>
<div class="section" id="primary-expressions">
<span id="index-2"></span><h3>4.2.1. Primary Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An identifer is a primary expression, provided it has been decared as
designating an object (in which case it is an lvalue) or a function (in which
case it is a function designator). Thus, an undeclared identifire is a violation
of syntax.</p>
<p>A constant is a primary expression. Its type depends on its form and lvalue (A
value whose memory address can be taken. All variables except addresses
themselves fall in this category).</p>
<p>A string literal is a primary expression. It is an lvalue.</p>
<p>A parenthesized expression is a primary expression. Its type and value are
identical to those of upparenthesized expression. It is an lvalue, a function
designator, or a void expression if the unparenthesized expression is,
respectively, an lvalue, a function designator, or a void expression.</p>

<div class="section" id="operators">
<h2>4.3. Operators<a class="headerlink" href="#operators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>C is very rich in operators considering the fact that it is so old. So what I
will do is that divide them in groups and then study them. Each operator is
given in its own section to ease the navigation. After describing the operators
example programs are also given with their output and brief description as
always.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="additive-operators">
<span id="index-3"></span><h2>4.4. Additive Operators<a class="headerlink" href="#additive-operators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two operators in this category. One you have seen in second chapter.
These are + and -.</p>
<p>For addition, either both the operands will have arithmetic type, or one operand
will be a pointer to an object type and the other will have integer type.
(Incrementing is equivalent to adding 1.) We will see pointer arithmetic in the
chapter dealing with pointers and arrays.</p>
<p>For subtraction following will hold:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>both operands have arithmetic type;</li>
<li>both operands are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible
object types; or</li>
<li>the left operand is a pointer to an object type and the right operand has
integer type. (Decrementing is equivalent to subtracting 1.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If both operands have arithmetic type, the usual arithmetic conversions are
performed on them. The result of the binary + operator is the sum of the
operands. The result of the binary - operator is the difference resulting from
the subtraction of the second operand from the first. There is also something
called pointer arithmetic which we will see in Chapter 6 describing pointers and
arrays.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiplicative-operators">
<span id="index-4"></span><h2>4.5. Multiplicative Operators<a class="headerlink" href="#multiplicative-operators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three multiplicative operators. These are *, / and %. Each of the
operands for these operands will have arithmetic type. That is character string
cannot participate. The operands of % will have interger type. The usual
arithmetic conversion are performed on the operands. The result of binary *
operator is the product of operands. The result of the / operator is the
quotient from the division; the result of the % operator is the remainder. In
both the operations, if denominator is zero, the behavior is undefined. When
integers are divided, the result of / operator is the algebraic quotient with
any fractional parts discarded. This is often called &#8220;truncation towards zero&#8221;.
Let us see a small program demonstrating these five arithmetic operators:</p>

<p>Same way you can udnerstand floating-point operations. Note that you cannot use
modulus operator if either of the operands are floating-point numbers as it will
make no sense because of data type promotion rules. Here data type promotion
rule says smaller data types will be converted to bigger data types. Also, if
there is a data type on left side of assignment the result of applying the
operator to operands will be converted to the type of that. chars are promoted
to ints, ints are promoted to floats anf floats to double. The point is that
conversion will try to keep as much data as possible.</p>

<span id="index-5"></span><h2>4.6. Relational Operators<a class="headerlink" href="#relational-operators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are four relational operators: &lt;, &gt;, &lt;= and &gt;=. One of the following will
be true for these operators:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>both operands have real type;</li>
<li>both operands are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible
object types (types that fully describe onjects; we will see pointers later);
or</li>
<li>both operands are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible
incomplete types (types that describe onjects but lack information needed to
determine their size).</li>
<li>If both the operands have arithmetic type, the usual arithmetic convrsions are
performed.</li>
<li>For the purposes of these operators, a pointer to an object that is not an
element of an array behaves the same as a pointer to the first element of an
array of length onr with the type of the object as its element type.</li>
<li>When two pointers are compared, the result depends on the relative locations
in the address space of the objects pointed to. If two pointers to object or
incomplete types both point to the same object, or both point one past the
last element of the same array object, they compare equal. If the objects
pointed to are members of the same aggregate object, pointers to structure
members declared later compare greater than pointers to members declared
earlier in the structure, and pointers to array elements with larger
subscript values compare greater than pointers to elements of the same array
with lower subscript values. All pointers to members of the same union object
compare equal. If the expression <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">P</span></tt> points to an element of an array object
and the expression <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Q</span></tt> points to the last element of the same array object,
the pointer expression <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Q+1</span></tt> compares greater than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">P</span></tt>. In all other
cases, the behavior is undefined.</li>
<li>Each of the operators <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></tt> (less than), <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></tt> (greater than), <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;=</span></tt> (less
than or equal to), and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;=</span></tt> (greater than or equal to) will yield 1 if the
specified relation is true and 0 if it is false. The expression a&lt;b&lt;c is not
implemented as in ordinary mathematics. As the syntax indicates, it means
(a&lt;b)&lt;c. The result has type int.</li>

<p>There are two equlity operators == and !=. Following contraints apply to these:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>both operands have arithmetic type;</li>
<li>both operands are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible
types; or</li>
<li>one operand is a pointer to an object or incomplete type and the other is a</li>
<li>pointer to a qualified or unqualified version of void; or</li>
<li>one operand is a pointer and the other is a null pointer constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given below are semantics of these operators.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The == (equal to) and != (not equal to) operators are analogous to the
relational operators except for their lower precedence. Because of the
precedences, a&lt;b == c&lt;d is 1 whenever a&lt;b and c&lt;d have the same truth-value.
Each of the operators yields 1 if the specified relation is true and 0 if it
is false. The result has type int. For any pair of operands, exactly one of
the relations is true.</li>
<li>If both of the operands have arithmetic type, the usual arithmetic conversions
are performed. Values of complex types are equal if and only if both their
real parts are equal and also their imaginary parts are equal. Any two values
of arithmetic types from different type domains are equal if and only if the
results of their conversions to the (complex) result type determined by the
usual arithmetic conversions are equal.</li>
<li>Otherwise, at least one operand is a pointer. If one operand is a pointer and
the other is a null pointer constant, the null pointer constant is converted
to the type of the pointer. If one operand is a pointer to an object or
incomplete type and the other is a pointer to a qualified or unqualified
version of void, the former is converted to the type of the latter.</li>
<li>Two pointers compare equal if and only if both are null pointers, both are
pointers to the same object (including a pointer to an object and a subobject
at its beginning) or function, both are pointers to one past the last element
of the same array object, or one is a pointer to one past the end of one array
object and the other is a pointer to the start of a different array object
that happens to immediately follow the first array object in the address
space.</li>
<li>For the purposes of these operators, a pointer to an object that is not an
element of an array behaves the same as a pointer to the first element of an
array of length one with the type of the object as its element type.</li>

<p>There is one increment and one decrement operator. ++ and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--</span></tt>. Both come
in two forms prefix and postfix. First we will see prefix versions then postfix
ones. There is only one constraint on prefix operators of these and that is the
operand of the prefix increment or decrement operator will have qualified or
unqualified real or pointer type and will be a modifiable lvalue.</p>
<p>The value of the operand of prefix ++ operator is incremented. The result is the
new value of the operand after incrementation. The ++E is equivalent to (E +=
1).</p>
<p>The prefix &#8211; operator is analogous to the prefix ++ operator except that the
value of the operand is decremented. Now we will see postfix ones; the
constraints are the same as prefix ones.</p>
<p>The result of the postfix ++ operator is the value of the operand. As a side
effect, the value of the operand object is incremented (that is, the value 1 of
the appropriate type is added to it). The value computation of the result is
sequenced before the side effect of updating the stored value of the operand.
With respect to an indeterminately-sequenced function call, the operation of
postfix ++ is a single evaluation. The prefix <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--</span></tt> operator is analogous
to the prefix ++ operator except that the value of the operand is incremented.

<p>The &amp;&amp; operator gives 1 if both the operands are non-zero else 0. The result type
is <strong>int</strong>. It is different from bitwise &amp; operator in the sense that it
guarantess left-to-right evaluation; if the second operand is evaluated, there is

left operand should be modifiable lvalue. An assignment operator stores a value
in the object designated by the left operand. An assignment expression has the
value of the left operand after the assignment, but is not an lvalue. The type of
an assignment expression is the type of the left operand unless the left operand
has qualified type, in which case it is the unqualified version of the type of
the left operand. The side effect of updating the stored value of the left
operand is sequenced after the value computations of the left and right operands.

<p>The first operand is evaluated; there is a sequence point between its evaluation

second operand is evaluated only if the first compares unequal to 0; the third
operand is evaluated only if the first compares equal to 0; the result is the
value of the second or third operand (whichever is evaluated), converted to the
type described below. Note that a conditional expression does not give an lvalue.</p>
<p>If both the second and third operands have arithmetic type, the result type that

those two operands, is the type of the result. If both the operands have
structure or union type, the result has that type. If both operands have void
type, the result has void type.</p>
<p>If both the second and third operands are pointers or one is a null pointer
constant and the other is a pointer, the result type is a pointer to a type
qualified with all the type qualifiers of the types pointed-to by both operands.
Furthermore, if both operands are pointers to compatible types or to differently qualified versions of compatible types, the result type is a pointer to an
appropriately qualified version of the composite type; if one operand is a null
pointer constant, the result has the type of the other operand; otherwise, one
operand is a pointer to void or a qualified version of void, in which case the
result type is a pointer to an appropriately qualified version of void.</p>

<p>You have already see sizeof operator in second chapter when we saw sizes of data
types. However here is the constraint: the sizeof operator will not be applied to
an expression that has function type or an incomplete type, to the parenthesized
name of such a type, or to an expression that designates a bit-field member.</p>
<p>The sizeof operator yields the size (in bytes) of its operand, which may be an
expression or the parenthesized name of a type. The size is determined from the
type of the operand. The result is an integer. If the type of the operand is a
variable length array type, the operand is evaluated; otherwise, the operand is
not evaluated and the result is an integer constant.</p>
<p>When applied to an operand that has type char, unsigned char, or signed char,
(or a qualified version thereof) the result is 1. When applied to an operand that
has array type, the result is the total number of bytes in the array. When
applied to an operand that has structure or union type, the result is the total
number of bytes in such an object, including internal and trailing padding.</p>

<p>The result of the unary + operator is the value of its (promoted) operand. The

<p>The result of the unary - operator is the negative of its (promoted) operand. The

<p>The result of the ~ operator is the bitwise complement of its (promoted) operand
(that is, each bit in the result is set if and only if the corresponding bit in
the converted operand is not set). The integer promotions are performed on the
operand, and the result has the promoted type. If the promoted type is an
unsigned type, the expression ~E is equivalent to the maximum value representable
in that type minus E.</p>

unequal to 0, 1 if the value of its operand compares equal to 0. Theresult has type
int. The expression !E is equivalent to (0==E).</p>
