Solutions for Ratios
********************
1. We have :math:`4:7` and :math:`11:5`. Therefore, ratio of these two ratios
is

.. math::
  \frac{4}{7}*\frac{5}{11}=\frac{20}{77}.

2. For :math:`13:24` and :math:`34:23` we have their ratio as

.. math::
  \frac{13}{24}*\frac{23}{34}=\frac{299}{816}.

3. a. For these two we make their denominators equal. We multiply and divide
   first by 6 and second by 5 then we have

.. math::
   \frac{4}{5}*\frac{6}{6} = \frac{24}{30}

and

.. math::
   \frac{5}{6}*\frac{5}{5} = \frac{25}{30}

Therefore, :math:`5:6` is greater.

b. Similarly, as in previous case

.. math::
   \frac{34}{33}*\frac{67}{67} = \frac{2278}{2211}

and

.. math::
   \frac{68}{67}*\frac{33}{33} = \frac{2244}{2211}

Clearly, :math:`34:33` is greater.

c. Following the principal from last two problems we have:
:math:`\frac{123}{63} = \frac{123*120}{63*120} = \frac{14760}{7860}` and
:math:`\frac{233}{120} = \frac{233*63}{120*63} = \frac{14679}{7860}`.
Clearly, 123:63 is greater than 233:63. 

4. a. Given ratio is 2(x+3):y-5. Therefore, duplicate, triplicate and subduplicate
   are given as follows:

.. math::
   \left(\frac{2(x+3)}{y-5}\right)^2, \left(\frac{2(x+3)}{y-5}\right)^3
   \text{and} \sqrt{\frac{2(x+3)}{y-5}}.

Expanding the forst two will give:

.. math::

   \frac{2x^2+12x+18}{y^2-10y+25}~\text{and}\frac{2x^3+6x^2+18x+54}{y^3-5y^2+25y-125}.

b. The given ratio is :math:`a^2+ab+b^2:a^3-b^3` which can be simplified to
:math:`1:a-b` and then our required ratios are
:math:`1:(a-b)^2, 1:(a-b)^3~\text{and}~1:\sqrt{a-b}`. Expansion gives following

.. math::

   \frac{1}{a^2-2ab+b^2}~\text{and}~\frac{1}{a^3-3a^2b+3ab^2-b^3}.

5. Given,

.. math::

   \frac{x-2}{x(x+7)} = \frac{7}{9}
   \Rightarrow~9x-18=21x+47
   \Rightarrow~12x=-165
   \Rightarrow~x=-\frac{55}{4}.

6. Let us say one no. is x the clearly second is :math:`x+126`. Now the ratio
is :math:`x:x+126` which should be equal to :math:`11:17`. Therefore, we have

.. math::

   \frac{x}{x+126}=\frac{11}{17}
   \Rightarrow~17x=11x+1386
   \Rightarrow~x=231.
7. Let us say the no. to be added is :math:`x` then we have from problem

.. math::

   
   \frac{5+x}{13+x}=\frac{5}{7}
   \Rightarrow~35+7x=65+5x
   \Rightarrow~x=15.
