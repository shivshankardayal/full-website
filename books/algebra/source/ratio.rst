Ratio
*****
We will study ratios in this chapter. Many of you might already be knowing
about ratios from earlier classes. A ratio is nothing but a comparison between
two quantities of same kine. For example, 4 balls vs 7 balls or 12 shoes vs
8 shoes.

A ratio beween two qualtities :math:`Q1` and :math:`Q2` is written as
:math:`Q1:Q2` most of the time. :math:`Q1` or the first term is called the
**antecedent** and the :math:`Q2` or the second term is called the
**consequent**.

To measure the ratio between two quantities typically we use fractions. A
reduced fraction is tells us about one quanity being multiples of another or
part of that. For example, 2 dozen bananas compared to 6 bananas can be written
as :math:`\frac{2*12}{6}` or 4.

Ratios are *abstract quantities* because they are sheer numbers. In practice,
considering our previous example we can say 2 dozen banans are four times 6
bananas. This four is an abstract quantity because it does not have a physical
form.

Clearly, you can see that

.. math::

  \frac{Q1}{Q1} = \frac{mQ1}{mQ2}

so the ratio does not change if numerator or antecedent and denominator or
consequent are multiplied by the same quantity.

Comparing Two Ratios
====================
To compare two ratios we need to make their denominator same the we can deduce
if they are equal or unequal. For example consider two ratios :math:`r1:r2` and
:math:`r3r4`. Then we can have

.. math::

  \frac{r1}{r2} = \frac{r1r4}{r2r4} ~~\&~~ \frac{r3}{r4} = \frac{r3r2}{r2r4}

Now since consequent is same for both the ratios we can determine which ratio
is bigger or equal or smaller by determining if :math:`r1r4` is bigger or
equal or smaller as compared to :math:`r2r3`.

Ratio of Ratios
===============
Clearly, a ratio can be represented by a fraction of two integers. Now let us
try to see what happens to ratio of two ratios:

Consider two ratios: :math:`a:b` and math:`c:d`. Thus we can write ratio of
these two raios as fraction

.. math::
  \frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}} ~~or~~ \frac{ad}{bc}

Therefore we can conclude that it is eqauivalent to :math:`ad:bc`.

Surds and Ratios
================
When I said a ratio can be applied as a fraction of two integers then that
applied to finite numbers. A *surd* like :math:`\sqrt{x}` is not a finite
number because certain portion of its fractional part if recurring.
Therefore, when a surd if involved a ratio cannot be represented as a fraction
of two integers.

When we can represent a ratio *exactly* by two integers the quantities are
called **commensurable** else they are called **incommensurable**.

Compounding Ratios
==================
Ratios are compounded by multiplying ratios. The multiplication is done in
simple fashion. Antecedents with antecedents and consequents with consequents.

For example, consider some ratios: :math:`a:b`, :math:`c:d` and :math:`e:f`.
The compounded ratio is :math:`abc:def`.

Duplicating Ratios
==================
When a ratio is compounded with itself once it is called **duplicate ratio**.
If it is compunded twice then it is called **triplicate ratio**. If a square
root is taken then it is called **subduplicate ratio**.

Antecedent vs Consequent
========================
A ratio is of *greater inequality*, or *less inequality* or of *equality*
depending on whether antecedent is greater or smaller or equal to the
consequent.

Common Properties of Ratios
===========================
A ratio of greater inequality is diminished and a ratio of less inequality is
increased if we add same quanitty to both its terms.

Let :math:`\frac{a}{b}` be a ratio and we add :math:`x` to both its terms so we
have :math:`\frac{a+x}{b+x}` as our new ratio.

Now,

.. math::

  \frac{a}{b}~-~\frac{a+x}{b+x}~=~\frac{ax-bx}{b(b+x)} \\
  =\frac{x(a-b)}{b(b+x)}.

and :math:`a-b` is positive or negative depending upon the fact whether
:math:`a` is greater or smaller than :math:`b`. Hence,

.. math::

  \text{if}~a\gt b,~~ \frac{a}{b}\gt\frac{a+x}{b+x}

  \text{and if}~ a\lt b,~~ \frac{a}{b}\lt\frac{a+x}{b+x}

Similarly, it can be proved that a ratio of greater inequality is icreased and
a ratio of less inequality is decreased if we subtract same quanitty to both
its terms.

When two or more ratios are equal we can denote that by a single symbol which
helps us in many ways.

Consider,

.. math::

  \text{If}~\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}=\frac{e}{f}= ... ,
  
  \text{each of these ratios}~=\left(\frac{pa^n+qc^n+re^n+ ...}{{pb^n+qd^n+rf^n}+ ...}\right)^\frac{1}{n}

  \text{Let}~\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}=\frac{e}{f}=...=k;

  \text{the}~a=bk, c=dk, e=fk, ...;

  \text{Hence},~pa^n=pb^nk^n,~qc^n=qd^nk^n,~re^n=rf^nk^n,...;

  \implies \left(\frac{pa^n+qb^n+re^n+ ...}{{pb^n+qd^n+rf^n}+ ...}\right) = \left(\frac{pb^nk^n+qd^nk^n+rf^nk^n+ ...}{{pb^n+qd^n+rf^n}+ ...}\right) = k^n

  \implies \left(\frac{pa^n+qb^n+re^n+ ...}{{pb^n+qd^n+rf^n}+  ...}\right)^\frac{1}{n} = k\\

Similarly, we can say that when a a number of fractions are equal, each of them
is equal to the sum of all the numerators divided by the sum of denominators,

.. math::

  \text{If}~\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}=\frac{e}{f}= ... ,

  \implies \frac{a+c+e}{b+d+f} = \frac{bk+dk+fk}{b+d+f} = k.

if :math:`\frac{a_1}{b_1}, \frac{a_2}{b_2}, ..., \frac{a_n}{b_n}` be unequal
fractions, of which denominators are all having the same sign, then the
fraction

.. math::
  \frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{b_1 + b_2+ .. +b_n}

lies in magnitude between the greatest and least of them.

Let all the denominators are positive. Let :math:`\frac{a_r}{b_r}` be the least fraction,
and denote it by :math:`k`; then

.. math::
  \frac{a_r}{b_r} = k; \therefore a_r = kb_r;

  \frac{a_1}{b_1} = k; \therefore a_1 = kb_1;

  \frac{a_2}{b_2} = k; \therefore a_2 = kb_2;

  \text{and so on;}

  \therefore \text{by addition,}

  a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n \gt (b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n)k;
  
  \therefore\frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n}\gt k; \text{that is,}\gt\frac{a_r}{b_r}

Similarly, we may prove that

.. math::
  \frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n}\gt k; \text{that is,}\lt\frac{a_s}{b_s}

where :math:`\frac{a_s}{b_s}` is greatest of the given functions.

If we have two equations containing three unknown variables in the first degree
such as

.. math::
  :label: Equation 1

  a_1x + b_1y + c = 0

.. math::
  :label: Equation 2

  a_2x + b_2y + c = 0

Rewriting these we can have following;

.. math::
  a_1\left(\frac{x}{z}\right) + b_1\left(\frac{y}{z}\right) + c_1 =0,

  a_2\left(\frac{x}{z}\right) + b_2\left(\frac{y}{z}\right) + c_2 =0,

Solving these we obtain,

.. math::
  \frac{x}{z}=\frac{b_1c_1-b_2c_1}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1},~~~\frac{y}{z}=\frac{c_1a_2-c_2a_1}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1}

or,

.. math::
  :label: Equation 3

  \frac{x}{b_1c_2-b_2c_1} = \frac{y}{c1_a_2-c_2a_1}=\frac{z}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1}

So we can see that for :math:`x` coefficients of :math:`y` and :math:`z` are
used and for :math:`y`, that of :math:`x` and :math:`z` are used and so on in
a cyclic manner.
