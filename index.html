<h1>About me</h1>
<p><img style="margin: 0pt 1em 1em 0pt; float: left;" src="images/me.jpg" />Hi! My
name is Shiv Shankar Dayal and I welcome you to my website. I am a software
programmer by choice though I hold a degree in Instrumentation Engineering.
I am a supporter of Free (Free as in Freedom, not price) Software and a fan of
Richard Stallman and computer scientists like Turing, Dijkstra, Knuth to name
a few.</p>
<p>
This is my place on internet where I will try to share my little knowledge
with people like you. My first sharing is a book on C99 along with 
<b>GNU/Linux</b> which I hope you will enjoy.
It is still in very nascent stage. Please note that content and topics are
ever increasing so keep visiting this page. Since English is not my
native language there is a very high chance that it may contain grammatically
incorrect content. Spellings I have correccted using <code>aspell</code>. But stil
there may be more and more typing mistakes and sometimes aspell cannot detect
out of context correct spellings so please review the material.
This website is a going to be a
collaborative effort towards a book which will contain the best of ideas. All
generated images were done using <b>METAPOST</b>. I have switched to <b>Matplotlib</b> system
for all my drawings which is much more natural for me being a C/C++/Python programmer
as my speciality. Now onwards all sources of images will be given for download
to users so that they learn that as well. Please see <b>Books</b> section
in menu. You can reach me at  shivshankar[.]dayal[@]gmail.com
</p>
<p>As such I will tell you about how to do programming in GNU/Linux but if
you are on Windows I advice you download <b>CodeBlocks</b> from 
<a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">http://www.codeblocks.org/</a> along with
gcc and gdb. It is a very nice replacement of Visual Studio. Also, you can
install <b>cygwin</b> or you can do a virtual GNU/Linux installation using
VirtualBox from
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>.
<b>Turbo C++</b> users may note that many programs
in this book will not work correctly as it requires minimum 32-bit compilers
and you have got 16-bit. 64-bit compiler users may note that output of many
programs will vary. <b>Turbo C++</b> is an ancient
compiler. No modern software is written using it. Please switch.</p>

<p>I am busy with some work so you may not see updates to
website for some time. I will be back soon.
</p>
<p>The idea of this new logo was inspired by Rick C. Hodgin. We the community
of free software programers bleed our eyes with a day job and then work at night
for our community. This shows the pain which we bear because of greedy
businessmen.</p>
<p><font color="#d00">Internet Explorer</font> users please excuse me if the
website does not render properly.</p>

It will be the end of all." - Shiv</p>
