Number System
*************
In this chapter we will study about number systems. We normally deal in
decimal number system. First question which will come to your mind is what is
a number system? Well, a number system is a system which determines the rules
and symbols for numbers on how we are going to use them. The symbols for
decimal number system are Arabic but they were taken from India, presumably.
A number system consists of symbols for representing numbers and a dot for
representing fractional numbers. Minus sign is used to represent negative
numbers. A number system ranges from :math:`-\infty` to :math:`+\infty`. It
is best represented by a straight line given below.

.. tikz:: Number axis

   \draw (0,0) -- (7,0);
   \draw (3.5, -0.2) -- (3.5, 0.2);
   \draw (3.5, 0.4) node {0};
   \draw (0, 0.4) node {$-\infty$};
   \draw (7, 0.4) node {$\infty$};
   \draw (0, -0.2) -- (0, 0.2);
   \draw (7, -0.2) -- (7, 0.2);

As you see the stretch of number axis, it makes me wonder what is infinity.
Infinity in itself is not a number to be honest in the sense that it is more
of a concept. Infinity is such a large number that cannot be written or
achieved by anything of physical world. Infinity is immeasurable. Each point
on this axis represents a number. It may be integer or fractional number. I
hope you know what is an integer. An integer is a whole number like -1, -2,
0, 5, 7 etc. Real numbers have fractional parts like 1.234. I cannot go much
into these basics. The **important fact** to note is that between any two
points there exists infinite numbers. In other words between any two numbers
there exists infinite numbers. For example, between 1.2 and 1.3 there are
1.21, 1.22, 1.23..., 1.29. Moreover between 1.21 and 1.22 there are 1.211,
1.212, 1.213 and so on.

Now let us come back to number system discussion. It enables us to represent
a point on this axis. The numbers I have written are supposedly in decimal
number system. Base of decimal number system is 10. Why because it consists
of 10 distinct symbols 0 through 9. Similarly we can have any other number
system. Popular number systems in computers are binary, octal and hexadecimal
not to mention decimal of course.

Definitions and Notations
=========================
1. **Quantity** is amount or and extent, is expressed in terms of a unit of the same kind.

   Thus, 10, 5 bushels, 6 tons, 50 miles, 7 years, 100 dollars, m square feet,
   n cubic yards, are quantities, the units in order being the abstract number 1,
   1 bushel, 1 ton, 1 mile, 1 year, 1 dollar, 1 square foot, 1 cubic yard.

2. Two or more of the same kind are **Commensurable**
   or **Incommensurable** with reference to one another
   **according** as they can or can not be measured with the same unit.

   Thus, if  the sides of a rectangle are 3 feet and 4 feet respectively, the
   diagonal is 5 feet, and  is, therefore, commensurable with the sides; but the
   diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its sides,  being :math:`\sqrt{2}`
   times one of the sides.

3. **An Incommensurable Quantity,** without comparison with another is  one that cannot be in the quantity,
   exactly expresseddecimal notation.

   Thus, :math:`\sqrt{5}` is an incommensurable quantity, being 2 plus a decimal fraction which never terminates.

4. Algebra is that branch of pure mathematics which treats of numbers  as and of expressed  by symbols having general
   values,the nature, transformations, and use of equations

5. Algebra differs from arithmetic in the following important particulars:

   i. In arithmetic values are counted in one direction only
      from 0; while  in algebra, by means of positive and negative values quantities,
      are counted in two opposite directions from 0.
   ii. Arithmetical quantities, denoted figures, have each a by single, definite value; while algebraical quantities,
       represented by
       letters have any value we choose to assign to them. These quantities can recognized anywhere operation, results formulae
       instead of answers. and the results, therefore, general formulae instead of specialized answers.
   iii. In arithmetic a problem is solved by analyzing it, step by while in the conditions are instep;  algebra
        expressed equations
        one or more unknown involving quantities, usually representing the answer or answers.
6. Algebra employs five kinds of symbols, viz. of quantity, of abbreviation, of operation, of relation, and of
   aggregation,

7. The Symbols of Quantity commonly employed are the following:

   i. The Arabic figures.
   ii. The letters of the Roman alphabet, known quantities being the letters, and unknown the represented by leading quantities
       by final letters.
       

   1d. Similar quantities employed in the demonstration of a theorem the solution of a problem are often represented the
   same by the same letter with different as read accents, a', a", a'", etc., prime, "a"", a"" a second prime and a""" a
   third prime. or by the same
   letter but different subscripts as :math:`a_1, a_2, a_3` being read as "a sub-one", "a sub-two" and "a sub-three."
   Initial letters are sometimes used, as :math:`r` for radius, :math:`s` for sum and :math:`d` for difference.

   2d. The Greek :math:`\pi` is used for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

   3d. Zero, 0, used to denote not only the absence of value, but also a  value that is less than quantity any
   assignable,

   4th. Infinity, :math:`\infty`, used to represent that is a quantity greater than any value assignable.

8. **The Symbols of Operation** in algebra are those common to all branches of mathematics, the principal ones being the
   following:

   1st. The sign of addition, + , read "plus."
   2d. The of subtraction, - , read "minus."
   3d. The sign of multiplication, x, read "into," or "times," or "multiplied by.".

   Multiplication is indicated also a dot between the  by quantities. The quantities  between which multiplication is
   indicated are quantities called *Factors,* and the result of the is called the *Product*.

   4th. The sign of division, :math:`\frac{}{}c`, read "divided by."
   Division is indicated also by writing the dividend above, and
   the divisor below, a line, in the fractional form.
   
   5th. The sign of evolution, :math:`\sqrt{}`, called the radical sign, and read "the root of," the root, or second
   root, one of square being the two factors into which a number is conceived to be resolved.  The 3d, 4th, or nth root,
   which is meant one of the by 3, 4, or n factors into which a number is conceived to be resolved, is indicated by
   writing 3, 4, or n in the vertex of the angle if the, the this number being called the Index, 

9. Besides the above signs, or symbols of operation, there are certain of with
   reference positions to quantities that indicate operations, the principal
   ones being the followings:

   i. **A Coefficient**, which is a quantity written beside another
      quantity to show  how many times the latter is taken.

      When algebraic quantities are written in succession with no sign between them, their product is signified, and factor, or
      any the of of factors, is the coefficient of the product anyproduct of the remaining factors.

      Thus, in 5 mnx, 5  is  the coefficient of mnx, 5m is the coefficient of nx,and 5
      mn is the coefficient of x. The name usually applies to the numerical factor, and
      when applied as 1 is it is not written.

   ii. **An Exponent,** which is a quantity written at the right  of
       and above another quantity, its meaning being as follows:

       a. quantity,  meaning being (a) When an exponent is a positive integer, it
       indicates that the quantity  affected by it is to be taken as a factor as many
       times as there are units in the The result of muliplication is called a Power
       hence a is said; positive integral exponent
       indicate power.

       Thus, :math:`a . a = a^2`, read "a square", "a 2d power" or "a 2d"
       :math:`\\a . a . a = a^3`, read "a cube", "a 3d power" or "a3d"
       :math:`\\a . a . a . a= a^3=4`, read "a 4th power", "a 4th"
       :math:`\\a . a . a ... n~times~a= a^n`, read "a nth power", "a nth"

       b. When an exponent is a positive fraction, [#]_ the numerator indicates a  power and the
       denominator a root of the quantity affected by it.

       Thus, :math:`32^{\frac{4}{5}}` is the :math:`4` th power of :math:`32` and :math:`5` the power of :math:`5`.
       There is glitch in that statement and you supposed to find it.

       c. When an exponent is negative, it indicates the reciprocal of what could have been as a positive exponent.
       Thus, :math:`b^{x+y} = \frac{1}{x * y}`


.. [#] It will be shown in later that if we assume  the index law as proved for positive integral exponents
   to be general, the meaning of positive fractional exponents and negative exponents must be as defined above.
   Until that article  is reached, their meaning will be treated as a matter of definition.


1. **Natural numbers** Numbers 1, 2, 3 4, ... used in ordinary counting are
called natural numbers or positive integers. The set of natural numbers is
denoted by **N**.

Thus N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}

2. **Integers:** The numbers ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... are 
called integers. These are whole numbers i.e. not fractions. The set for 
integers is denoted by **I** or **Z**.

This I or Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

Clearly, :math:`N \subset Z`.

3. **Zero:** 0 is an integer but a special integer. It is neither 
negative not positive but 1's complement in binary number system has two zero 
one positive and one negative while 2's complement has only one zero. Zero is 
treated as a non-negative as well as non-positive integer.

**Examples:**

i)   Set of positive integers = {1, 2,3, ...}
ii)  Set of negative integers = {-1, -2, -3, ...}
iii) Set of non-negative integers = {0, 1, 2, ...}
iv)  Set of non-positive integers = {0, -1, -2, ...}

   \draw (7, -0.7) node {or};
   \draw (7, -1) node {Natural Numbers};
   
4. **Rational Numbers:** is a number of form :math:`\frac{a}{b}` where :math:`a` 
and :math:`b` are integers and :math:`b\ne 0`. The set of rational numbers is
denoted by **Q**.

Thus Q= :math:`\{\frac{a}{b}: a,b\in Q \text{ and } b\ne 0\}`. Since :math:`b`
is an integer it can very well be 1 therefore each number of the form
:math:`\frac{a}{1}` which is nothing but :math:`a` is also a rational number.

Clearly, :math:`N\subset Z\subset Q`. Examples of rational numbers are
:math:`\frac{2}{3}, -\frac{3}{4}, 7` etc. 0 is an integer and hence a rational
number.

5. **Decimal form of a rational number is either recurring or terminating** As
we know that base of decimal number system is 10 which has 
two prime factors. Now if denominator of a rational number is not one and
contains any other factor than 2 and 5 then the rational number will be
recurring and if it is only product of powers of 2 and 5 or is 1 then the
rational number will be terminating. This can be generalized for any base or
radix :math:`r` which has say prime factors :math:`r_1, r_2, ..., r_n` then in
that case if denominator contains any other factor than these then that
rational number will be recurring else terminating.
  
For example :math:`\frac{3}{4}=0.75` while
:math:`\frac{3}{7}=.4285714285714...`
  
It is safe to assume that :math:`a` and :math:`b` do not have a common factor
because that factor can be eliminated without changing the value of the
rational number.

6. **Standard form of a rational number:** A rational number of the 
form :math:`\frac{a}{b}` is said to be in standard form if :math:`a` and
:math:`b` have no factor in common other than 1 and :math:`b>0`.

7. **Irrational numbers:** Consider a rational number
:math:`\frac{a}{b}=\sqrt{2}`. By definition of rational numbers :math:`a` and
:math:`b` cannot have a common factor. But then :math:`a,b\in Z` which is not
the case here as :math:`a \text{ or } b` is not an integer. Therefore, it is
not a rational number. The reason is if both of them are integers then the
rational number cannot be square root of a number. Hence, we can conclude that
this fraction :math:`\frac{a}{b}` is an irrational numbers and there are
infinite such irrational numbers.

8. **Decimal form of an irrational number is neither terminating nor
recurring** For example \:math:`sqrt{5}=1.732...`

9. **Real numbers:** All rational and irrational numbers are also
known as real numbers which is denoted by set **R**.

Clearly, :math:`N\subset Z\subset Q\subset R`

Binary Number System
==================== 
.. index::
  pair: binary; number system

As the name suggests binary number system has base of 2. Therefore it has
only two symbols. 0 and 1. This is the most popular system for computers
because TTL NAND and NOR gates which are the most basic logic gates using
which other gates are implemented in processor has only two voltage output
levels because of their operation in cut-off and saturation zones. These
terms are better understood with the help of a book on electronics which is
out of scope of this book. All binary numbers consist of 0 and 1. So the
count is like 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000 and so on.

Counting in Binary Number System
--------------------------------
First 0 then 1 the what? Why 10? Because that is the next bigger number you
can form using 0 and 1. Also, 10 when converted to decimal is 2. This
represents base. 10 in any number system represents the base of that system.
After conversion to decimal. Note you can read it ten but it is not really
ten. There are no tens in binary. When you say ten by default we mean that of
decimal system. A number has no meaning without its base. So you can better
write it as :math:`10_2`. The subscript denotes the base.

Conversion of Decimal and Binary
--------------------------------
Consider a decimal number. Let us say 53 then how would be convert it to
binary. The technique is that of division. Please watch following carefully::

  2 | 53 | 1
  ----------
  2 | 26 | 0
  ----------
  2 | 13 | 1
  ----------
  2 | 6  | 0
  ----------
  2 | 3  | 1
  ----------
  2 | 1  |
  
So the binary is :math:`110101_2`. Please allow me to explain the process
even though it is trivial and obvious. First we divide 53 by 2 and write
the remainder. Then quotient is 26. We repeat the process for 26 therefore
remainder is 0 and quotient is 13. This we go on repeating till we have 1 as
quotient. Note that all the remainders will be 0 or 1 because divisor is 2.
Similarly, final quotient is always 1. Now we take final quotient and start
writing remainders from top to bottom.

To convert binary to decimal let us examine following:

.. math::
	1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 53_{10}

The power is to 2 because 2 is the base of source. It starts from 0 for unit's
position and increases to 1 and 2 for ten's and hundred's position and so on.
1's and 0's are the values of that place. If you note carefully powers of 2
grow like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and so on. Any number can be written
by using these powers at most one time. For example consider 100. I know it is
less than 128 so I will use 64. Then 36 remains. So I will use 32 and then 4.
This means :math:`100 = 64 + 32 + 4` which means power 6, 5 and 2 have been
used. Therefore, I can quickly write down number as :math:`1100100_2`.

Fractional numbers are slightly more complicated. Let us consider
:math:`1.1_2`. In decimal it will be :math:`1 + \frac{1}{2}`. This is 1.5 in
decimal. Note that when you convert a fractional part of binary to decimal
denominator will always be power of 2. For that matter when you convert from
any base to decimal denominator will be powers of that base. **Important**
Therefore, when you convert from decimal to some base n then denominator of
that decimal number can have only those prime factors which are available in
the set of prime factors of n.

Operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
are similar in all number systems.

A Generic Positional Number System
==================================
.. index::
  pair: positional; number system

Let us try to describe a number in a generic number system which is given
below:

.. math::
  :label: A generic positional number

  (.. c_mb^{m-1} + c_{m-1}b^{m-2}+ ... + c_2b^1 + c1_b^0 + c_{-1}b^{-1} + ... + c_{-m}b^{-m} ) \\  
  = (... c_mc_{m-1}...c_2c_1.c_{-1}...c_{-m})_b

As you can see all the terms with :math:`c` are called digits. The leftmost or
leading digit is called *most significant digit* and the rightmost or trailing
digit is called *least significant digit*. The . is called a point which
separates the integral part which is towards its left from the fractional part
which is towards its right. :math:`b` is known as radix or base of the number
system. Note that all digits will be between 0 to :math:`b-1`. So in our
decimal system :math:`b` is 10 therefore we have digits from 0 to 9. In binary
number system it is 2 therefore digits permitted are 0 and 1.

These are the basics of number systems i.e. the numbers themselves. When we
return back from our journey of Mathematics to Data structures and Algorithms
I will discuss more on number theory and about Alan Turing and how the world's
shape changed because of him and foundation of computer science was laid.
