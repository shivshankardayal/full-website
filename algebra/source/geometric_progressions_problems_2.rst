Geometric Progressions Problems Part 1
**************************************
51. If :math:`a` be the first term, :math:`b` be the :math:`n\text{th}` term
    and :math:`p` the product of :math:`n` terms of a G. P., show that
    :math:`p^2 = (ab)^n`.

52. Show that the ratio of the sums of :math:`n` terrms of two G.P.'s gaving
    the same common ratio is equal to the ratio of the their :math:`n\text{th}`
    terms.

53. If :math:`S_1, S_2, S_3` be the sum of :math:`n, 2n, 3n` terms respectively
    of a G. P>, show that :math:`(S_2 - S_1)^2 = S_1(S_3 - S_2)`.

54. If :math:`S_n` denotes the sum of :math:`n` terms of a G. P., whose first
    term is :math:`a` and common ratio is :math:`r`, find :math:`S_1 + S_2 +
    ... + S_{2n - 1}`.

55. The sum of :math:`n` terms are is :math:`a.2^n - b`, find its
    :math:`n\text{th}` term. Are the terms of this series in G. P.?

56. If :math:`n\text{th}` term of a series is :math:`3.2^n - 4`, find the sum
    of its 100 terms.
