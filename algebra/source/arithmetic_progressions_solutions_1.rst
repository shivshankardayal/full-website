Arithmetic Progression Solutions Part1
**************************************
1. First term of the sequence is :math:`t_1 = 1^2 + 4 = 5.` Second term of the
   sequence is :math:`t_2 = 2^2 + 4 = 8.` Similarly third term is :math:`t_3 =
   3^2 + 4 = 13.` Difference between first two is 8 - 5 = 3 and thee difference
   between last two is 13 - 8 = 5. Since the differences are not equal so the
   sequence is not an A.P.

2. :math:`t_3 = t_1 + t_2 = 3 + 5 = 8.`

   :math:`t_4 = t_2 + t_3 = 8 + 5 = 13.`

   :math:`t_5 = t_3 + t_4 = 13 + 8 = 21.`

3. Clearly, common difference = d = 9 - 2 = 7. No. of terms = :math:`\frac{93 -
   2}{7} + 1 = 14.`

4. The first series is 2, 4, 6, ..., 200 for 100 terms and second series is 3,
   6, 9, ..., 240 for 80 terms. Clearly, first common term is 6 and common
   difference is also 6 which is least common multiple of 6. So common terms
   are 6, 12, 18, ..., 198. So total no. of identical terms are
   :math:`\frac{198 - 6}{6} + 1 = 33.`

5. (i) :math:`t_1 = 4, t_2 = 7, t_3 = 10, ...`
   (ii) .. math::
          t_1 = \frac{1}{2}, t_2 = \frac{2}{3}, t_3 = \frac{3}{4}, ...
   (iii) .. math::
           t_1 = \frac{1}{2}, t_2 = \frac{4}{3}, t_4 = \frac{10}{3}, ...

6. :math:`t_1 = 2a + b, t_2 = 4a + b.` Common difference = :math:`d = t_n -
   t-{n - 1} = 2a.` Since common term is independent of n and is a constant
   therefore the sequence is in A.P.

7. :math:`t_7 = a + 6d \because c.d. = -1 - (-4) = 3 \text{ and } a = -4 t_7
   = -4 + 18 = 14.`

8. The first 3 digit no. divisible by 7 is 105. Then we can find remaining by
   addding 7 to them. So the sequence is 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147,
   154, ..., 994.

9. Let first term is a and common difference is d. Given 7th term is 34 and
   12th term is 64. So :math:`a + 6d = 34` and :math:`a + 11d = 64.` So
   :math:`d = 6.` Therefore :math:`a = -2.` So 10th term is :math:`-2 + 9*6 =
   52.`

10. This problem is similar to 4 and is left as an exercise.

11. Let the terms are :math:`a - d, a, a + d.` Sum is 15 so :math:`a = 5.`

    Sum of squares is 83. Therefore :math:`3a^2 + 2d^2 = 83 \Rightarrow d = \pm
    2.` So the terms are :math:`3, 5, 7` or :math:`7, 5, 3.`

12. This problem is similar to 11 and has been left as an exercise to the
    reader.

13. This problem is similar to 11 and has been left as an exercise to the
    reader.

14. Given :math:`S_n = 5n^2 + 3n`, thus, :math:`S_{n-1} = 5(n - 1)^2 + 3(n -
    1)`.

    :math:`\therefore t_n = S_n - S_{n - 1} = 10n - 2`

15. Given :math:`S_n = an^2 + bn`, thus, :math:`S_{n-1} = a(n - 1)^2 + b(n -
    1)`

    :math:`\therefore t_n = 2an - (a - b)`

16. Clearly, :math:`t_1 = (a + b)^2` and :math:`c.d. = d = -2ab`

    :math:`\therefore S_n = n[a^2 + b^2 + ab(3 - n)]`

17. Let :math:`n` be the number of sides of the polygon. From geometry the sum
    of angles of polygon is :math:`= (n - 2)180^{\circ}`

    Given :math:`a = 120^{\circ}` and :math:`d=5^{\circ}`

    :math:`\therefore` Sum on interior angles of the polygon

    :math:`\Rightarrow \frac{n}{2}[120 + (n - 1)5]` (in degrees)

    :math:`\Rightarrow \frac{n}{2}[240 + 5n - 5] = 180n - 360`

    :math:`\Rightarrow 5n^2 - 125n + 720 = 0`

    Roots of this equation are :math:`n = 9, 16`

    For :math:`n = 16` greatest angle is :math:`195^{\circ}` but from geometry
    no interior angle of a polygon can be greater than :math:`180^{\circ}`,
    therefore no. of sides of the polygon is :math:`9`.

18. The sum will be maximum till the first negative term. It is evident that
    :math:`a = 40` and :math:`d = -2`.

    :math:`t_n = 40 + (n - 1)\times -2 < 0`

    :math:`\therefore n > 21`

    Consequently, first 21 terms will give the maximum sum for this A. P.

    :math:`S = \frac{21}{2}[80 + (21 - 1)\times -2] = 420`

19. Given :math:`1 + 3 + 5 + 7 ... to n terms \ge 500`

    :math:`\therefore \frac{n}{2}[2 + (n - 1)2] \ge 500` or :math:`n^2 \ge 500`

    :math:`n \ge \pm \sqrt{500}` but :math:`n` is a positive number

    :math:`n \ge \sqrt{500}` :math:`n \ge 22.36`

    Thus, least value of :math:`n` is 23.

20. Let :math:`a` be the first term and :math:`d` be the common difference of
    this A. P.

    Given, :math:`mt_m = nt_n`

    :math:`\therefore m[a + (m - 1)d] = n[a + (n - 1)d]`

    :math:`a = d[1 - (m + n)]~~~~(\because m \neq n)`

    :math:`t_{m + n} = a + (m + n - 1)d = 0`

21. Let :math:`x` by the first term and :math:`d` be the common difference
    of A. P.

    Given, :math:`a = pth` term of A. P. :math:`= x + (p - 1)d`

    :math:`b = qth` term of A. P. :math:`= x + (q - 1)d`

    :math:`c = rth` term of A. P. :math:`= x + (r - 1)d`

    :math:`\therefore a - c = (p - r)d, b - a = (q - r)d, c - b = (r - q)d`

    :math:`\Rightarrow a(q - r) + b(r - p) + c(p - q)`

    :math:`\Rightarrow q(a - c) + r(b - a) + p(c - b)`

    :math:`\Rightarrow q(p - r)d + r(q - p)d + p(r - q)d = 0`.

22. :math:`\because a, b, c` are in A. P.

    :math:`\Rightarrow a - (a + b + c), b - (a + b + c), c - (a + b + c)` are in A. P.

    :math:`\Rightarrow -(b + c), -(a + c), -(a + b)` are in A. P.

    :math:`\Rightarrow b + c, a + c, a+b` are in A. P.

23. :math:`\because a^2, b^2, c^2` are in A. P.

    :math:`\Leftrightarrow b^2 - a^2 = c^2 - b^2`

    :math:`\Leftrightarrow (b + a)(b - a) = (c + b)(c - b)`

    :math:`\Leftrightarrow \frac{b - a}{b + c} = \frac{c - b}{a + b}`

    :math:`\Leftrightarrow \frac{b + c - c -a}{(c + a)(b + c)} = \frac{c + a -
    a - b}{(a + b)(c + a)}`

    :math:`\Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{c + a} - \frac{1}{b + c} = \frac{1}{a + b}-
    \frac{1}{c + a}`

    :math:`\therefore \frac{1}{b + c}, \frac{1}{c + a}, \frac{1}{a + b}` are
    in A. P.

24. :math:`t_p = q = a + (p - 1)d` and :math:`t_q = p = a + (q - 1)d`

    Subtracting we get

    :math:`q - p = (p - q)d \Rightarrow d = -1`

    Substituting the value of :math:`d` in any of the above terms' equation

    :math:`\therefore a = p + q - 1`. Using these values of :math:`a` and
    :math:`d` to find the :math:`(p + q)`th term

    :math:`t_{p + q} = a + (p + q - 1)d = 0`

25. L. H. S. = :math:`t_m + t_{2n + m}`

    :math:`\Rightarrow a + (m - 1)d + a + (2n + m - 1)d`

    :math:`\Rightarrow 2a + (2m + 2n -2)d`

    :math:`\Rightarrow 2[a + (m + n - 1)]d = 2t_{m + n}`

26. :math:`\because \frac{a}{b + c}, \frac{b}{c + a}, \frac{c}{a + b}` are
    in A. P.

    Adding 1

    :math:`\Rightarrow \frac{a}{b + c} + 1, \frac{b}{c + a} + 1, \frac{c}{a +
    b} + 1` are in A. P.

    :math:`\Rightarrow \frac{a + b + c}{b + c}, \frac{a + b + c}{c + a},
    \frac{a + b + c}{a + b}` are in A. P.

    Dividing by :math:`a + b + c`

    :math:`\frac{1}{b + c}, \frac{1}{c + a}, \frac{1}{a + b}` are in A. P.
