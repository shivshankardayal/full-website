Geometric Progressions
**********************
A succession of numbers is said to be in geometric progression or geometric
sequence if the ratio of any term and the term preceding it is constant
throughout. This constant is called common ratio of the G. P.

Example: :math:`1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...`

Here, :math:`\frac{\text{2nd term}}{\text{1st term}} = \frac{\text{3rd
term}}{\text{2nd term}} = ... = 2`.

Also, :math:`1, 3, 9, 27, ...` are in geometric progression whose first term is
:math:`1` and common ratio is :math:`3`.
