     the letters of the word 'proportion'?
316. A five letter word is formed such that the letter appearing in the odd
     numbered positions are taken from the letters which appear without
     repetitions in the word MATHEMATICS. Further, the letters appearing in
     the even numbered positions are taken from the letter which appear with

     :math:`2n` grandchildren. They are to be seated in a row for dinner. The
     grandchildren wish to occupy the :math:`n` seats at each end and
     grandfather refuses to have a grandchild on either side of him. In how
     many ways can the family be made to sit?
321. There are :math:`2n` quests at a dinner party. If the master and mistress
     of the house have fixed seats opposite one another and that there are
