Proportions
***********
There are many times when two ratios are equal. Then the four quantities
involved in these two ratios are said to be in proportion or **proportionals**.
Thus if :math:`a:b=c:d` then :math:`a, b, c` and :math:`d` are proportionals
or are in proportion. It is also written as

.. math::
  a:b::c:d.

The terms :math:`a` and `d` are called the *extremes* and :math:`b` and
:math:`c` are the *means*. Clearly, as you can see that if there is such
a proportion then product of extremes is equal to the product of means i.e.
:math:`ad=bc`.

Continued Proportion
====================
Quatities are said to be in **continued proportion** when first is to second
is equal to second is to third, third is to fourth is equal to first two; and
so on. Therefore, if

.. math::
  \frac{a}{b}=\frac{b}{c}=\frac{c}{d}=.....

then :math:`a, b, c, d, ...` are in contunued proportion.

If three quantities :math:`a, b` and :math:`c` are in proportion then,

.. math::
  a:b=b:c;
  
  \therefore ac=b^2

Here, :math:`b` is called **mean proportional** between :math:`a` and :math:`c`
and :math:`c` is called **third proportional** between :math:`a` and :math:`b`.

If three quantities are in proportionals then the first is to the third is in
the duplicate ratio of the first to the second.

Let us say three quantities are :math:`a, b` and :math:`c`. Then we have,

.. math::
  \frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{c}

Now we can say following:

.. math::
  \frac{a}{c} = \frac{a}{b}*\frac{b}{c} =  \frac{a}{b}*\frac{a}{b}=\frac{a^2}{b^2}

If :math:`a:b=c:d` and :math:`e:f=g:h`, the we will have :math:`ae:bf=cg:dh`.

For :math:`\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}` and :math:`\frac{e}{f}=\frac{g}{h}`;

.. math::
  \therefore \frac{ae}{bf}=\frac{cg}{fh},

or :math:`ae:bf=cg:dh`

If :math:`a:b=c:d` and :math:`b:x=d:y` then :math:`a:x=c:y`.

Proportions are essentially fractions and therefore we can apply properties of
fractions to them and many useful relations can be established, which, can be
very useful later on. Names of some of these operations come from **Geometry**.

Invertendo
----------
If :math:`a:b=c:d`, then :math:`b:a=d:c`.

This is too easy and therefore left as an exercise to the reader.

Alternando
----------
If :math:`a:b=c:d`, then :math:`a:c=b:d`.

We have,

.. math::
  \frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}

  \implies ad=bc

  \text{Dividing both side by}~cd~\text{we get}

  \frac{ad}{cd}=\frac{bc}{cd};

  \implies \frac{a}{c}=\frac{b}{d};

  \therefore a:c=b:d

Componendo
----------
If :math:`a:b=c:d`, then :math:`a+b:b=c+d:d`.

We have,

.. math::
  \frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}

  \text{adding 1 to both side}

  \frac{a}{b}+1=\frac{c}{d}+1

.. math::
  :label: Componendo

  \therefore \frac{a+b}{b}=\frac{c+d}{d}

.. math::
  \text{or}~~a+b:b=c+d:d

Dividendo
---------
If :math:`a:b=c:d`, then :math:`a-b:b=c-d:d`.

We have,

.. math::
  \frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}

  \text{subtracting 1 from both side}

  \frac{a}{b}-1=\frac{c}{d}-1

.. math::
  :label: Dividendo

  \therefore \frac{a-b}{b}=\frac{c-d}{d}
  
.. math::
  \text{or}~~a-b:b=c-d:d

Dividing (1) by (2) we get,

.. math::
  :label: Componendo and dividendo

  \frac{a+b}{a-b}=\frac{c+d}{c-d}

This relation is known as *Componendo & Dividendo*.
